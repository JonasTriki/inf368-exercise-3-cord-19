    "title": "Clinical and immunologic studies in identical twins discordant for systemic lupus erythematosus",
    "body_text": "The patient (Fo, ) was a 58 year old mentally retarded white woman, born in a rural area of southwestern Virginia.\nIn July 1967 she was referred to the University of Virginia Hospital (UVH) because of edema of the legs and facial swelling of recent onset. She admitted having arthralgias but denied having recent rash, pleurisy or hair loss. Previous medical history revealed that a systolic heart murmur had been heard in 1962. A hemogram and urinalysis at that time were normal. In June 1963 she had been admitted to her local hospital with congestive heart failure attributed to mitral insufficiency.\nLaboratory studies included a positive lupus erythematosus cell preparation, and she received a brief course of prednisone therapy. A pruritic rash of her neck and trunk was recorded in June 1964.\nFamily members included a healthy twin sister (Case 2), who was identical in appearance.\nThe sisters shared the phenotype Gm (3, 5, 13, 14) ; Inv(-l)* and common red blood cell groups (type 0, DcE/ DcE).\nTheir histocompatibility lymphocyte typing against 100 serums was identical, being HL-Al and HL-A3 and Te50 positive.?\nOn physical examination the patient had a left pleural effusion and pitting edema of both legs. There was no skin rash or joint abnormalities.\nUrine sediment showed 10 to 20 white blood cells and 10 to 15 red blood cells/high power field, with many doubly refractile fat bodies under polarized light. Other laboratory data included a hematocrit value of 28 per cent, white blood cell count 9,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen 28 mg,ilOO ml and creatinine clearance 24 ml/min. Serologic studies were as follows: latex nucleoprotein 3+, lupus erythematosus cell preparation positive, hemolytic complement (C'H50) 28 units (normal range 34 to 48 units) and rheumatoid factor (RF) negative. Hypoproteinemia (serum albumin 1.7 g/100 ml) and abnormal urine sediment were considered to be secondary to active lupus glomerulonephritis.\nIn addition a urine culture showed infection. The patient was treated with diuretics, prednisone and antibiotics.\nIn December 1967 the patient and her twin sister were moved to a nursing home. The following month the patient was rehospitalized with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, a left pleural effusion and edema extending from both feet to the iliac crests. Microscopic hematuria. proteinuria (4 g/24 hours), and depressed serum complement (22 to 33 C'H50 units) were consistent with active SLE, and the dose of prednisone was increased to 80 mg/day. Her course was complicated by progressive azotemia (blood urea nitrogen reaching a maximum of 210 mg/lOO ml), which was gradually reversed by increasing intravascular volume. The dose of prednisone was tapered and then discontinued in late March 1968. Clinically, the patient's condition sta-*Courtesy of A. G. Steinberg, M.D., Department of Biology, Case Western Reserve University,\nCleveland, Ohio, who tested forGm (1,2,3,4,5,13,14.21) and Inv (1) bilized (blood urea nitrogen 80 mgilO0 ml). and she remained asymptomatic.\nBlood pressure ranged from 160 to _l80/90 to 100 mm Hg. and there was no peripheral edema. Her urine continued to show 2-l-protein, numerous white cells (cultures usually positive), hyaline and granular casts, and doubly refractive fat bodies.\nBoth twins were hospitalized in June 1970 in the Clinical Research Center for concurrent immunologic evaluation.\nNeither twin had specific complaints. One (Case l), however, had decreased renal function, documented by a blood urea nitrogen level of 100 mg/lOO ml, serum creatinine of 4.4 mg/lOO ml, and 24 hour protein excretion of 2.1 to 7.3 g. Although antinuclear factor remained positive, a lupus erythematosus cell preparation was negative, and serum complement was normal. Serum deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)binding activity (performed subsequently on serum stored from this hospitalization) was 60 per cent (normal controls less than 20 per cent) [12] . Glucose tolerance test was also abnormal (blood sugar 109 mg/ 100 ml, fasting 288 mg/lOO ml at 1 hour, 330 mg/lOO ml at 2 hours and 142 mg/lOO ml at 3 hours). During late 1970 the patient's condition deteriorated. In early October a urinary tract Infection developed with gram-negative sepsis, and although her condition improved temporarily, she died in December.\nAt autopsy extensive chronic polyserositis was found, with fibrous pleural, pericardial and peritoneal adhesions, particularly over the spleen and liver. The heart was moderately enlarged due to left ventricular hypertrophy (420 g). but the coronary arteries were free of significant disease. Except for focal calcification jn the mitral valve ring, the valves of the heart were normal;\nLibman-Sachs endocarditis was not seen. The spleen was slightly enlarged (200 g), congested and firm. The liver was unremarkable.\nThe kidneys were pale and diffusely granular. The right kidney also contained a large ischemic scar and weighed only 70 g as compared to the left kidney, which weighed 130 g. Histologic sections of the kidneys showed diffusely thickened glomerular basement membranes, glomerular hypercellularity and adhesions of some glomerular tufts to Bowman's capsule. Many glomeruli were hyalinized, with associated atrophy and interstitial infiltrate of lymphocytes. Sections of lung contained evidence of multiple small old pulmonary emboli.\nThe remainder of the examination was noncontributory.\nCase 2. This patient (Fe) is the identical twin sister of the patient just described (Case 1). She spent her entire life with her sister in a remote cabin until December 1967 when they moved to the nursing home. She was examined at UVH for the first time in August 1968. She denied having any previous illnesses, as well as photosensitivity, rash, arthralgias or pleurisy. Blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg, and other than the mental retardation physical examination revealed no abnormalities.\nLaboratory data obtained during two outpatient visits (August 1968 and April 1970) were normal (hematocrit 42 per cent. white blood cell count 8,700/mm3, blood urea nitrogen 16 mg/lOO ml) except for slight hypergammaglobulinemia (1.5 to 2.2 g/l00 ml). Routine urinalysis showed an occasional white blood cell and no proteinuria.\nThere was no serologic evidence of SLE.\nThis patient was hospitalized with her sister (Case 1) in the Clinical Research Center in June 1970 so that her immunologic status could be evaluated. Blood pressure was 130 to 160/90 mm Hg, and there was thyroid enlargement with irregularity in the left upper lobe. Serum thyroxine levels, chest roentgenogram and electrocardiogram were normal. C;hest roentgenogram and electrocardiogram were normal. Glucose tolerance test was abnormal (blood sugar fasting 122 mg/lOO ml, 372 mg/lOO ml at 1 hour, 270 mg/ 100 ml at 2 hours, 64 mg/lOO ml at 3 hours). The patient was last seen by us in January 1972 when there was still no clinical or laboratory evidence to suggest SLE.\nSLE as the etiology of the patient's nephritis (Case 1) was first suggested by the positive lupus erythematosus cell preparation in 1963. Subsequently the presence of antinuclear factor, anti DNA, decreased serum complement, cryoglobulins and, at autopsy, polyserositis and histologic changes in the kidneys, supported the diagnosis of SLE. The healthy identical twin at age 59 (Case 2) has never had any symptoms suggestive of SLE. Multiple blood samples tested for lupus erythematosus cells, antinuclear factor, anti DNA, rheumatoid factor and cryoglobulins (Table I) Delayed hypersensitivity to common antigens was assessed by the intradermal injection of 0.1 ml of 1:40 streptokinase-streptodornase (SK-SD), (Varidasew, Lederle, Pearl River, N.Y.), 1:30 Trichophyton (Hollister Stier, Yeadon, Pa.) and 1 :lOO Candida albicans (Hollister Stier). Response was measured as millimeters of induration after 5, 24 and 48 hours. KLH Immunization.\nResponse to a foreign antigen was evaluated after immunization with KLH. KLH was obtained as an ammonium sulfate precipitate from the Pacific Biomarine Supply Company, Venice, Calif. This material was prepared in the associated form by a method modified from Campbell and co-workers [15] . It was filtered through a 0.45 p Millipore@ filter, and Merthiolate@ (1:1500) was added. KLH 2 mg was injected subcutaneously and serum samples were obtained frequently for several weeks.\nAntibody to KLH was measured by the tanned cell hemagglutination micromethod [16] . Formalinized sheep red blood cells were tanned and then coated with 1.5 mg KLH/ml of packed red cells. Agglutination was read after 4 hours in plastic microtiter trays.\nSucrose gradient centrifugation was performed on selected serums (positive for anti-KLH) to measure relative amounts of antibody in 7s and 19s fractions. Sucrose was layered in concentrations from 60 to IO per cent (ph6sphate buffered solution, pH 7.3) and 0.5 ml aliquot of a 1:4 dilution of serum was placed at the top. Bromphenol blue was used as a marker for albumin. Centrifugation at 100,000 X G was carried out for 15 hours. Five-tenth milliliter fractions were taken from the bottom of the tubes and reassayed for anti-KLH by hemagglutination and double diffusion in agarose.\nSkin tests for delayed hypersensitivity were performed on the 13th and 35th days after immunization, with observations recorded after 24, 48 and 72 hours. Biopsy specimens from the areas injected .with 10 pg KLH were obtained 48 hours after the second skin tests were performed.\nStudies.\nThe proliferative response of the twins' lymphocytes to KLH and phytohemagglutinin (PI-IA) was determined using previously described technics [17] . In brief, 5 X lo6 washed (Case 2) which increased in size when injections of 10 and 100 pg were given (Table I I ). In contrast, there was no cutaneous response to the injection of 1 or 10 pg of KLH in the twin with SLE (Case 1), and after the injection of 100 pg only a 4 by 5 mm site of induration was observed. Biopsy of the 10 mm sites confirmed the difference in response of the twin sisters; there was a paucity of lymphocytes near blood vessels and surrounding dermis in the section from the twin with SLE (Case 1), whereas a round cell infiltrate typical of delayed hypersensitivity was apparent in the dermis of the healthy twin (Case 2). Lymphocyte blastogenic response (Table II) : Prior to immunization, neither twin's lymphocytes could be stimulated by 15 pg/ml KLH. The healthy sister (Case 2) demonstrated sensitization of her lymphocytes to KLH 14 days after immunization at this time. 3HTdr uptake by stimulated cells were 3.6 times control values. By 28 days after immunization this response had increased to 49 times control values. In contrast, lymphocytes from the twins with SLE (Case 1) failed to respond to KLH. 3HTdr uptake of her stimulated cells was never greater than two times control values. The kinetics of the 28 day response to KLH are reported elsewhere [19] .\nThe main observations which emerge from these case studies include: first, SLE developed in only one member of a set of genetically and environmentally similar twins, and second, the affected twin showed a marked difference between humoral and cellular response to an administered antigen. Titers represent averages of tubes 2, 3 and 4 (19S), and 5, 6 and 7 (7s).\nAnother difficulty has been the lack of uniform criteria in establishing the diagnosis of SLE. In two patients, in separate reports, the diagnosis was made solely on clinical grounds [4, 8] . In addition to fulfilling the criteria for the diagnosis of SLE recommended by the American Rheumatism Association [22] , the serologic and postmortem findings confirmed the clinical impression in our patient. Our twins are the oldest in the series of previous studies (ages 3 to 41), lessening the likelihood that the disease will develop in the healthy twin. These patients are also unusual in that they shared the same environment into adult life and that similar antibody titers to multiple viruses developed.\nAlthough in these twins there was remarkable correlation between the antibody titer and the antibody response after KLH immunization, their cellmediated responses were different. Delayed cutaneous reactions and lymphocyte proliferative responses to antigens were decreased in the twin with SLE (Case 1) suggesting that she had impaired delayed hypersensitivity.\nWhen these stud-",

    "abstract": "Abstract Middle-aged female identical twins, one of whom had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), were evaluated for immunologic reactivity to previous antigenic challenges, including primary immunization with a foreign antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). These two women had lived together for all of their 58 years and neither was receiving anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive drugs at the time of these studies. Both twins demonstrated comparable 7S and 198 humoral antibody response to KLH, as well as similar viral antibody titers. However, the twin with SLE was anergic to common antigens, streptokinase-streptodornase, Trichophyton and Candida; furthermore delayed hypersensitivity to KLH did not develop after immunization. This observed discrepancy between humoral and cellular immunity in genetically similar subjects may be significant in the pathogenesis of SLE.",

    "title": "Infectious diarrhea: Pathogenesis and risk factors",
    "body_text": "Pathogenesis and Risk Factors J. ROBERT CANTEY, M.D. Charleston, South Carolina Our understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious, especially bacterial, diarrhea has increased dramatically. New etiologic agents, mechanisms, and diseases have become known. For example, Escherlchla coli serogroup 0157 is now known to cause acute hemorrhagic colitis. Also, E. coli serogroups that produce Shiga toxin are recognized as etiologic agents In the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The production of bacterial diarrhea has two major facets, bacterial-mucosal interaction and the induction of intestinal fluid loss by enterotoxins. Bacterial-mucosal interaction can be described In stages: (1) adherence to eplthelial celi microvilli, which is often promoted by or associated with phi; (2) close adherence (enteroadherence), usually by classic enteropathogenic E. coli, to mucosal epithellal cells lacking microvilli; and (3) mucosal invasion, as with Shigella and Salmonella infections. Further large strides in understanding lnfectlous diarrhea are likely with the cloning of virulence genes if additional host-specific animal pathogens become available for study.\nThe past few years have witnessed an explosion in the number of publications exploring many aspects of infectious diarrhea. This review will examine the present status of our understanding of pathogenesis.\nNonspecific host barriers to infection are summarized diagramatically in Figure 1 . The first barrier to be encountered in the passage of the infectious agent from the oropharynx is gastric acidity, which is sufficient to kill or inhibit many Enterobacteriaceae [l] . Gut motility is important in preventing infectious agents from approaching the mucosa, as is evident from the fact that animals given opiates to decrease motility experience diarrhea with infectious agents to which they would not ordinarily be susceptible [2] . The \"unstirred water layer,\" a zone of retarded diffusion of solutes in the intestine [3] , could slow the movement of infectious agents toward the mucosal epithelium. The layer of intestinal mucus would also interfere. Beneath the mucous layer is the glycocalyx, which is anchored in the plasmalemma of the epithelial cell and consists of long strands of protein with carbohydrate side chains [4] . Once the infectious agent penetrates the glycocalyx, it could adhere directly to the plasmalemma or invade the epithelial cell. infections . The jejunum is the major site of infection, but the ileum may also be involved [8-l 11. Intestinal villus shortening, crypt hypertrophy, increased epithelial cell turnover, and acute inflammation all occur [7,8,10-151. Epithelial cell microvilli are shortened, blunted, and decreased in number [7, 14, 15] . The deficiency of brush border disaccharidase and sodium/potassium-ATPase activity that is thought to produce diarrhea in viral gastrointestinal infections is a reflection of the increase in immature crypt-type enterocytes on the villus epithelium [8-l 0,13,15] . Little is known about viral-mucosal epithelial cell interaction, except that specific receptors on the epithelial cell seem necessary in Norwalk virus diarrhea [la] .\nBacterial-mucosal interaction may be divided into several stages: adherence to intact microvilli, adherence to the surfaces of epithelial cells that have lost their microvilli, termed \"enteroadherence,\" and invasion of the mucosal epithelial cells. There are likely other stages, but examples are not well documented. Current evidence indicates that bacteria that produce diarrhea also synthesize some form of enterotoxin. The following comments focus on the bacterial-mucosal interactions that are best understood. Bacteria That-Are Confined to the Lumen. Adherence to intact microvllli: The mechanisms and relevant surface structures of the interaction of Vibrio cholerae with human and animal intestinal epithelium remain poorly understood, partly because study has been hampered by the lack of pathogenicity of V. cholerae in animals. Such studies as have been done indicate that V. cholerae ad-heres to gut epithelial cells in order to produce diarrhea [17-221. Surface structures important to adherence are unknown. Although it may adhere, V. cholerae type 01 does not invade. Ultrastructural studies of human and animal cholera reveal minimal changes in gut epithelial cells and microvillus border [23-251. More is known about the pathogenesis of enterotoxigenie Escherichia coli diarrhea, as host-specific animal pathogens-and, thus, good animal models-are readily available. Enterotoxigenic E. coli can be seen adhering to intact microvilli in ultrastructural studies [28] . Those that cause diarrhea in pigs were the first bacteria demonstrated to possess pilus (fimbrial) adherence ligands [271.\nThe pilus or fimbria [28-311 is a filamentous surface protein that is 0.5 to 2 pm long, approximately 7 nm in diameter, and composed of 15 to 20 kilodalton repeating units with an aggregate molecular weight in excess of one million. There are two major groups of pili. The first is the common or type 1 pilus that is associated with mannosesensitive nonspecific adherence to red cells or various other dells [28, 31] . The second group includes pili thought to mediate adherence to specific cells in specific species, the so-called colonization factor antigens [32] . The genes of the type 1 pili usually reside on the bacterial genome, whereas the genes for the latter pili usually reside in plasmid DNA. The porcine E. coli pili were initially believed to be thermolabile polysaccharide antigens and were labeled K88 antigens [33] . The ability of K88-positive enterotoxigenic E. coli to cause diarrhea in pig(lets) was shown to be increased by the K88 antigen. Since that time, other adherence pili of enterotoxigenic E. coli have been described, including K99 in calves, lambs, 987 in pigs [35, 37, 38], F41 in calves, lambs, and CFA I and II in humans and infant rabbits [32, . The K88 pilus increases adherence in the upper small bowel, whereas the K99 and 987 pili increase adherence in the distal small bowel. Increased in vivo adherence and diarrhea1 attack rate is correlated with in vitro adherence to gut mucosal epithelial cells and partially purified gut epithelial cell brush border [48-521. Pilus adherence ligands are limited in variety in animals, in contrast to the human species, in which a large stable of ligands still does not account for the majority of enterotoxigenic E. coli. The lack of a completely satisfactory in vitro adherence assay for human-associated species of enterotoxigenic E. coli has led to an array of assays and different, often overlapping, pilus typing schemes (Table I) . The two major schema are those of Evans et al [43, 44] and Deneke et al [53-551. My reasons for referring to adherence as pilus-associated, rather than being due to pili, are several. First, consider Table I . Human strains of E. coli adhere to animal tissues [43, 44] , and animal strains adhere to human tissues [52, 56] . If bacteria can show preference for proximal or distal small bowel, why do they show lack of specificity concerning species? Perhaps the adherence assays are measuring a characteristic that is not related to adherence in vivo in the preferred species. Additionally, there are major differences among laboratories, which may reflect shortcomings of the assays. For example, in one study, K88-positive bacteria but not K99-positive bacteria adhered to human ileostomy cells [56] . In a different laboratory, K99-positive but not K88-positive bacteria adhered to human jejunal cells [52] .\nAnother reason for concern is the following. Studies with both human and animal strains of bacteria have used bacteria whose virulence characteristics, such as pili, have been deleted by exposure of the parent bacterium to nonselective mutagens. In no case has the mutant been carefully examined as to possible associated changes in outer membrane proteins, ability to grow in the anaerobic environment of the gut, and other variables. The same can be said for transfer of pilus-associated plasmids. The plasmids are often quite large, and they contain more genes than would likely be necessary for pilus synthesis. How might these additional genes change the recipient bacterium?\nEnteroadherent bacteria: E. coli, in humans, usually members of the classic enteropathogenic E. coli serogroups that adhere closely to epithelial cells lacking microvilli, have been termed enteroadherent [571 or enteroeffacing [58] . The phenomenon of clos& adherence of enteropathogenic E. coli was first reported in cesariandelivered monocontaminated pigs given a 10\" inoculum of serogroup 055 E. coli [59] . The histopathologic features and characteristics of the disease were reported in detail and postulated to be a previously unrecognized mechanism of E. coli diarrhea in rabbits given a lo6 inoculum of rabbit-specific enteroadherent E. coli strain RDEC-1 [60-621. Similar histopathologic findings have since been reported in humans infected with enteropathogepic E. coli serogroups 0111, 0119, and 0125 E. coli [63-651. The bacteria first interact with intact microvilli of mucosal epithelial cells of the distal ileum and colon [62] . The microvilli form round bodies and disappear [62] . The bacteria then adhere closely (approximately 11 nm [Sl] ) to the epithelial cell surface, which tends to cup the bacterium by forming pedestal-like structures [62, 64] (Figure 2 ). Invasion of the epithelial cells does not occur. The RDEC-1 strain adheres first to M cells in the epithelium of the Peyer's patches [57], but it is not known whether human strains do the same. In an autopsy series, infants dying of serogroup 0111 E. coli diarrhea had lymphoid hyperplasia, but close adherence of bacteria was not noted [66] .\nHuman strains of enteropathogenic E. coli have been found to adhere to Hep-2 and more recently HeLa cells in culture with greater frequency than non-enteropathogenic E. coli strains [67-691, providing investigators with a useful diagnostic and epidemiologic tool. Serotype 0111 and 0119 E. coli strains isolated from patients whose jejunal biopsy specimens revealed typical close adherence are The adherence ligand of the RDEC-1 strain is plasmidmediated, highly specific for the rabbit, and is either a pilus structure or is on the same plasmid and cotransferred with pilus expression [71] . An idea of the forces involved in the early stage of adherence of the RDEC-1 strain to intact microvilli may be gathered by studies in which piliated RDEC-1 strain bacteria caused much larger rabbit ileal cell brush borders to aggregate in large visible clumps [72] . Human strains of enteroadherent E. coli do not appear to be piliated under the culture conditions used thus far [73] . RDEC-1 pili are expressed in one medium and suppressed in another [62, 71, 72] , so it may be a matter of finding the right set of culture conditions. The ability of human enteroadherent E. coli to adhere to Hep-2 cells is associated with and can be transferred to another bacterium with a large plasmid [74] . Invasive Bacteria. The pathogenesis of shigellosis has been the subject of much research, particularly by Formal and his colleagues at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research [75-771. The Shigella bacterium adheres to and invades mucosal epithelial cells of the distal small bowel and colon. In an elegant series of experiments, one plasmid and three sites on the bacterial genome necessary for virulence traits of shigellae, including invasion of HeLa cells, mucosal inflammation, a positive Sereny result, and production of fluid in the rabbit ileal loop by Shigella (flexneri) have been localized [78, 79] . When these genes are instilled in an E. coli K12 strain, it exhibits all of the virulence properties of a fully virulent Shigella. The genes necessary for invasion of HeLa cells are located on a large 140 megadalton plasmid that causes minicells to synthesize outer membrane proteins, which by inference are important in HeLa cell invasion [80] . The his region of the bacterial genome, which codes, among other things, for 0 antigen synthesis, is important for mucosal inflammation [79] . Studies by Wantanabe et al [81, 82] indicate that a small plasmid, which codes for a 41,000 megadalton protein involved in the formation of 0 side chains, is important for production of a positive Sereny result by a Shigella flexneri type 1 strain. Together, these latter data confirm a role for surface polysaccharides in virulence of shigellae but do not indicate a role in adherence. Shigellae have not been shown to possess any type of pilus protein that might be important in adherence. Thus, although the stages of pathogenesis of shigellosis have been clearly delineated, the structures relevant to each stage of pathogenesis have not been determined.\nSalmonellae adhere to mucosal epithelium in the process of invading it, a process that has been well described using electron microscopic techniques [83] . Microvillus border and epithelial cells are altered, although not se- Figure 2 . Cecal tissue taken from a rabbit with enteroadherent E. co/i strain RDEC-1 diarrhea. The tissue was treated with fertitin-conjugated RDEC-l-specific IgG but was not stained after embedment The fertitin-labeled bactetia are closely associated with the lumenal surface of a mucosal epithelial cell that has been denuded of microvilli. Several of the bacteria are cupped with the pedestallike structures common in tissues infected with enteroadherent E. co/i. Bar = 1 CL.\nverely, in the process of invasion. The bacterium prefers the Peyer's patch [84, 85] , as does the rabbit strain of enteroadherent E. coli [571. Invasion and adherence are associated with a 80 megadalton plasmid [88] . Salmonella typhimurium exhibits type 1 pilj (mannose-sensitive) that are associated with an increased infectivity in the mouse [871. Salmonellae can adhere to Henle cells or adhere to and invade HeLa cells in tissue culture, a characteristic that is mannose-resistant and not thought to be due to pili [88-901. The surface features involved in adherence and invasion of Salmonella are not known. Vi antigen, a surface polysaccharide of Salmonella typhi that interferes with the ability of anti-0 antigen serum to react with the 0 antigen [91] (a similar antigen is a feature of enteropathogenie serotypes of E. coli), increases the virulence of S. typhi strains for human volunteers in an unknown fashion WI.\nAdherence phenomena are, in general, species-restricted. In contrast, enterotoxins show no preference concerning species, a characteristic that has greatly facilitated their study. Vibrio cholerae and, to a lesser extent, enterotoxigenic E. coli synthesize enterotoxic material in such quantity that the enterotoxin activity can be easily detected in culture supematant. It is uncertain whether the toxins are actively excreted or released into the medium with membrane material [93] . Cholera toxin has been highly purified, has a molecular weight of approximately 92,000 daltons and is known to be composed of three subunits, Al, A2 and B. Subunit Al is an enzyme and ADP-ribosylates GTP-regulatory protein, a component of the adenylate cyclase system. The result is an increase in intracellular cAMP levels, which elicit the specific biologic response of the cell exposed to the toxin. Subunit A2 plays a role in toxin internalization. The B subunit, of which there are five per molecule, is the ligand thought to be responsible for binding cholera toxin to GM1 ganglioside in the plasma membrane of cells (any cell). Labile toxin of E. coli is similar to cholera toxin in most respects.\nThe effect of both toxins on intestinal villus cells is the inhibition of sodium absorption and hence of chloride and water. In crypt cells, sodium secretion is increased, with the consequent loss of chloride and water. Details of this can be found in several reviews [94-97. Stable toxin ST of E. coli, in contrast to cholera toxin and E. coli labile toxin, is not an enzyme and has a molecular weight of about 2,000 daltons [98] . It exists in two or perhaps more forms, STa and STb [QQ-1011. STa, which is synthesized by both human and animal strains and has been sequenced, acts by stimulating guanylate cyclase, which produces an increase in cGMP [lo1 -1051. ST is specific for intestinal cells, where it inhibits absorption of fluid and electrolytes. It appears to produce some chloride secretion as well [105] . STb-producing strains are usually of porcine origin. The mode of action of STb, which is different from that of STa, is unknown.\nSalmonella infection results in an elevation of CAMP in gut tissues, but it is not clear whether the increase is due to an enterotoxin or to the effects of invasion [108, 107] . Studies of Salmonella lysates indicate that both cytotoxins and enterotoxins are present [108-l lo], but published data are conflicting as to their nature.\nShiga toxin, first recognized as a toxin of Shigella dysenteriae 1 in 1903 [l 111, is a protein toxin that is cytotoxic for HeLa cells and Vero cells, neurotoxic in mice and rabbits, and enterotoxic in the rabbit ileal loop [112] , and has been highly purified in several laboratories [113-l 18) . In contrast to cholera toxin, Shiga toxin has an adverse effect on epithelial cells when injected into the rabbit ileal loop [117] . The molecular weight of the native toxin is probably in the range of 70,000 daltons [114, 116] . Crude data suggest the possibility of an A subunit with an approximate molecular weight of 30,000 daltons and a much smaller B subunit [118] . The toxin binds to a glycoprotein on the (HeLa) cell surface, is translocated into the cell in an energy-dependent step, and binds to and inactivates the 60s ribosomal subunit [l 1 Q-l 211.\nThe exact role of this toxin in Shigella diarrhea remains uncertain. However, in monkeys given S. flexneri by mouth, diarrhea developed before dysentery and was accompanied by jejunal colonization but not invasion, and there was secretion of water into the jejunum [122] . When the bacteria were given directly into the cecum, dysentery occurred, but there was no diarrhea, and water transport was normal in the jejunum [123] . These two observations comprise the only evidence for a role of Shiga toxin in shigellosis, but it is believed that such a role exists. In a series of publications, O'Brien and co-workers [124-l 261 have shown that a wide variety of bacteria that cause diarrhea also produce Shiga toxin (Table II) . In fact, only three of the many strains of bacteria tested thus far have not produced toxin. The key to being able to find the toxin in lysates of so many different bacteria was an observation by Dubos and Geiger [128] in 1946 that inorganic iron in the medium decreased the yield of Shiga toxin. When O'Brien and LaVeck [127] removed iron from the medium, the Shiga toxin was more easily detected. The question of the precise role for the Shiga toxin in bacterial diarrhea is critical if the full impact of ,the work of O'Brien and colleagues is to be known, especially since many of the bacteria listed in Table II produce other potent enterotoxins, including cholera toxin, Hemorrhagic colitis, due to E. coli serogroup 0157 (129,130], and hemolytic-uremic syndrome, associated with infection with several E. coli serogroups, but especially serogroups 026 and 0157 [131, 132] , are two syndromes in which it seems highly likely that Shiga toxin will be important in pathogenesis. These E. coli produce large amounts of Shiga toxin (Table II) . It is worth noting that E. coli 026 was initially reported to synthesize Vero cell toxin [133, 134] as was the E. coli associated with hemolytic-uremic syndrome. In fact, the Vero cell cytotoxin could easify be detected in the feces [131] . It is now thought that the Vero and Shiga toxins are one and the same [125, 132] .\nSome years ago, lysates of several enteropathogenic E. coli serogroups were said to cause net transport of water into the lumen in a rat jejunal perfusion assay [135] . The same E. coli was known to cause diarrhea in humans [136] . The question that must now be answered is whether the jejunal perfusion assay measures Shiga toxin or some other, as yet uncharacterized, toxin.\nEntamoeba histolytica dysentery is the best understood of the protozoan diarrheas. The only histopathologic study of in vivo interaction of E. histolytica-mucosal epithelial cell interaction is an ultrastructural study in germ-free guinea pigs inoculated intracecally with E. histolytica and enteric flora of a human patient with acute amebic colitis [13fl. In that model, with its obvious limitations, the amebas ap proached the epithelial cell, the microvillus border disap peared, the epfthelial cell became detached from the lamina propria and adjoining epithelial cells, and the amebas invaded by passing between the detached epithelial cells. Guerrant and colleagues [136, 139] have examined the in vitro interaction of axenic amebas with Chinese hamster ovary cells and have described several stages in the interaction: adherence, extracellular cytolysis of the Chinese hamster ovary cell, and phagocytosis of the lysed cell. Adherence but not phagocytosis was inhibited by Nacetyl-D-galactosamine. The work of other investigators corroborates these studies [140-1421. E. histolytica possesses a cytotoxin, probably a protease enzyme, the quantity of which is correlated with virulence 1143-1461. It has been suggested that this material is important in the tissue destruction produced by the invading amebas. E. histolytica also has enterotoxic activity. Some type of enterotoxic activity has been described in amebic preparations in three different laboratories, including our own [143, 147, 146] .\nOur understanding of the pathogenesis of Giardia infections is too sketchy to be worthy of comment. The same is true for the Cryptosporidium, except that it has a histopathologic picture similar to that of enteroadherent E. coli. It adheres closely to mucosal epithelial cells in areas lacking microvillus border in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome [149] .\nRisk factors may be categorized as environmental or host-specific in origin. The impact of the environment reflects the fact that the usual route of spread of diarrhea1 diseases is fecal-oral. The spread may be from person to person or there may be an intermediate step, such as contamination of water or food with infected feces. Living conditions, which often reflect socioeconomic conditions, have a major impact on diarrhea1 attack rates. A recent study in Brazil identified the unavailability of sanitary facilities and crowding in the poorer families as particular risk factors [150] . The quality and quantity of water are also quite important [151] . Locale and season of the year influence the prevalence and attack rates for specific pathogens. For example, enterotoxigenic E. coli is more common in the tropics in the summer, whereas rotavirus diarrhea is more common in temperate zones in the fall and winter.\nHost behavioral patterns can be quite important and do not always reflect poor personal hygiene due to lack of education. For example, amebiasis is more common among male homosexuals [152] . Firemen and policemen scuba diving off Long Island had a high incidence of protozoan diarrheas, probably due to diving in polluted waters without a mask that completely covered the face [153] .\nHost physical factors may be specific or nonspecific. Decreased gastric acidity increases the risk for infectious diarrhea because acid conditions have an adverse impact on bacterial growth [l] . Malnutrition is known to increase diarrhea1 attack rates [ 154, 155] .\nSpecific host factors include receptor and immunologic status. Enterotoxigenic E. coli strains show restricted spe ties specificity. Animal enterotoxigenic E. coli strains are not known to infect humans. Human enterotoxigenic E. coli strains do not cause diarrhea in animals without major manipulation of the animal host. Species specificity is presumably due to the presence of specific receptors on mucosal epithelial cells. Specificity can vary within a species. Some strains of pigs have a decreased affinity for the K66 adherence ligand that is reflected in a decreased diarrheal attack rate [156] . On the other hand, host species is not as important for some pathogens, such as Salmonella. The presence of receptors may also be age-related. The RDEC-1 enteroadherent E. coli does not adhere to ileal brush borders until the rabbits are 20 days old [157] .\nFinally, immunologic status is important. The susceptibility of weanling animals and human infants to infectious diarrhea is well known and is thought to be due to the lack of protective mucosal antibody that, prior to weaning, was supplied in the maternal milk [150, 156, 159] . Severe immunosuppression, whether due to immunosuppressive drugs or infection, is a recognized risk factor. Bone marrow transplant recipients are susceptible to a variety of infectious agents that produce diarrhea [160] . Debilitating cryptosporidial diarrhea, heretofore unknown, is common among patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome [149] .\nIt is obvious that there has been a dramatic resurgence of interest in pathogenesis of infectious diarrheas. The interaction of infectious agents with mucosal surfaces is a complex process that easily frustrates attempts to unlock ACKNOWLEDGMENT its secrets.

    "abstract": "Abstract Our understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious, especially bacterial, diarrhea has increased dramatically. New etiologic agents, mechanisms, and diseases have become known. For example, Escherichia coli serogroup 0157 is now known to cause acute hemorrhagic colitis. Also, E. coli serogroups that produce Shiga toxin are recognized as etiologic agents in the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The production of bacterial diarrhea has two major facets, bacterial-mucosal interaction and the induction of intestinal fluid loss by enterotoxins. Bacterial-mucosal interaction can be described in stages: (1) adherence to epithelial cell microvilli, which is often promoted by or associated with pill; (2) close adherence (enteroadherence), usually by classic enteropathogenic E. coli, to mucosal epithelial cells lacking microvilli; and (3) mucosal invasion, as with Shigella and Salmonella infections. Further large strides in understanding infectious diarrhea are likely with the cloning of virulence genes if additional host-specific animal pathogens become available for study.",

    "body_text": "In the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, locally produced antibodies complex with an inciting antigen, yet to be identified, within the joint and activate the complement system, resulting in articular inflammation mediated primarily by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and their products. Chronic inflammatory cells then produce soluble factors that induce both tissue destruction and inflammation.\nA major issue is how and why apparently normal immune responses in the acute stage progress to chronic inflammation in subsequent months to years. Although it is often assumed that the initial etiologic agent, persisting in the joint or at an extra-articular site, is responsible for continued synovitis, this need not be the case. It is possible that once the inciting agent is cleared from the joint through a normal immune response, the presence of activated cells rich in surface class II histocompatibility (Ia) antigens could, under the influence of multiple genetic or environmental factors, become the target of autoimmune attack. Alternatively, the process might result from the interactions of synovial lining cells and their products with T cells assuming a secondary role. Further research into the relative contributions of soluble products, T helper and suppressor subsets, synoviocytes, and antigen determine which model is correct. R heumatoid arthritis is a complex disease of unknown origin in which genetic, hormonal, and immunologic factors interact to produce joint and systemic manifestations. Both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune response appear to participate [l] . The former is responsible for the exudative phase of the arthritis. Antibodies made within the joint space, particularly rheumatoid factors (anti-immunoglobulins), complex with antigens and engage the complement system. The resultant articular inflammation is mediated primarily by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and their products. Cellular immunity is represented by the chronic inflammatory cells (e.g., lymphocytes and macrophages) that infiltrate the synovium and produce soluble factors that induce both tissue destruction and inflammation [Zl. In this article, I will consider some of the factors that are known or suspected to contribute to the initiation and perpetuation of rheumatoid arthritis, focusing especially on the notion that pathways other than conventional T cell-mediated immune responses may be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic rheumatoid synovitis.\nA proper understanding of the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis requires an appreciation of the distortion of the joint architecture that is produced by the disease. Normal diarthrodial joints are lined by a fine membrane comprised of differentiated connective tissue cells (synoviocytes) sitting on a loose acelluar stroma, interspersed with a rich network of small capillaries. Two types of synoviocyte that differ in function and morphology have been identified. The first (\"type A\" synoviocyte) is phagocytic and has morphologic and phenotypic characteristics of a histiocytic cell derived from the monocyte/macrophage lineage. The other (\"type B\" synoviocyte) resembles a fibroblast. The phagocytic cells are constantly replaced by precursors from the bone marrow; the origin of the synovial fibroblast is less clear [31. The earliest recorded change in the joint during the days to weeks following the first symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis is damage to the endothelium of the microvasculature [4, 5] . At about the same time, a sparse infiltration of the edematous subsynovial space with acute inflammatory cells (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) occurs and fibrin is deposited along the synovium. A modest increase in the number of lining cells can be seen, but the lymphocytes and plasma cells that are so conspicuous in established disease are virtually absent (Figure 1 ). In the subsequent weeks, segmental obliteration of the microvasculature by inflammatory cells and thrombi develops, and lining cell hyperplasia and perivascular accumulation of lymphocytes becomes evident ( Figure 2 ).\nAs the disease becomes more chronic and wellestablished, the characteristic morphologic features of rheumatoid arthritis can be recognized C31. These include a great increase in the number and size of lining cells, synovial villous hypertrophy, massive subinti-ma1 infiltration by lymphocytes and plasma cells (often associated with large lymphocytic nodules), in-growth of a chronic granulation tissue, and proliferation of subchondral connective tissue (pannus) that erodes cartilage, bone, ligaments, and tendons. Phenotypic and functional analyses of the infiltrating lymphocytes show them to be primarily CD4 cells of the helper subclass. This is especially notable for CD4 cells located in proximity to macrophages that express large amounts of glycoproteins coded for by the class II genes of the major histocompatibility complex (hereafter referred to as immune activation or Ia antigens) 16-101. This picture is analogous to that seen in antigen-presenting regions in lymphatic tissues where B lymphocytes and plasma cells are scattered in and about the T cells [2, 7, 8] . A proportion produce immunoglobulins, some with specificities similar to the rheumatoid factors found in the circulation.\nAlthough the actual events leading to the established rheumatoid arthritis lesion are not entirely understood, it is generally thought to begin when an antigen, arguably a joint-seeking (\"arthrotropic\") pathogen, comes to the joint from an extra-articular location. The responsible factor is unknown, but viruses harbored in macrophages or lymphocytes, non-biodegradable products of bacteria, or antibodies directed against intra-articular structures have all been implicated as potential candidates. At some point, the initial microvascular insult and inflammation becomes a chronic inflammatory process. In the generally accepted scenario, this switch results from a T cellmediated immune reaction directed at the persisting pathogen ( Figure 3 ).\nMuch evidence has been advanced to support this sequence of events [ll] . The histology of rheumatoid arthritis synovitis is reminiscent of chronic immunologic reactions in laboratory animals. The joint lesions of Lyme arthritis (caused by minute amounts of spirochetal antigens), are similar to those of rheumatoid arthritis [12] . The T cells from synovial effusions, and to a lesser extent from subintimal tissues, display cell surface molecules that are associated with an \"activated state,\" such as Ia antigen [6, 8, 91 . Large amounts of Ia antigens are also seen on synovial lining cells and interdigitating macrophages. Ia antigen induction is generally due to gamma-interferon, a classic lymphokine secreted by stimulated T cells [9, 13] . Lymphocytes intimately associated with Ia-rich accessory cells produce a variety of other lymphokines that, along with macrophage-derived factors, can promote synovial proliferation and the growth and differentiation of B lymphocytes into antibody-secreting cells [ll] . Finally, several new or exotic therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (thoracic duct drainage, total lymphoid irradiation, and cyclosporin) are targeted at T lymphocytes. Thus, the paradigm that rheumatoid arthritis synovitis results from a typical T cell-driven immune response can explain: (1) tion. Indeed no alternative view would be acceptable unless it could account for these three hallmarks of synovitis. At this point! it is important to recognize that not all the available information supports the notion that rheumatoid synovitis results-from a conventional T cell-mediated immune response. First, the classic findings of rheumatoid arthritis synovial histopathology are not always present [14, 151 . Although biopsy specimens from many patients have lymphoid aggregation and immunoreactive regions containing interdigitating antigen-presenting cells and T helper lymphocytes, others from patients with an identical clinical picture show a diffuse infiltration of the synovium with equal numbers of T cells of the CD4 and CD8 phenotype. In a minority of patients, the interstitial region contain primarily fibroblasts and only a few lymphocytes.\nEven more disquieting is the paucity of data supporting the paradigm that T cell activation actually occurs in the rheumatoid arthritis synovium. Ordinarily, when appropriately stimulated, T lymphocytes will sequentially display activation antigens (Ia, interleukin-2 receptor, and transferrin) on their surface, elaborate lymphokines, such as interleukin - Although interleukin-2 receptors are present on some cells, the degree of expression at the mRNA level is little more than that of resting peripheral blood T cells, rather than that found in mitogen-stimulated cells. T cell mitosis and blast transformation are rare 1161, and only a minority of the cells in a typical synovial lymphoid follicle stain with an antibody that identifies nuclear antigens present in all stages of the cell cycle apart from Go [17] . Taken together, these findings suggest that although the T lymphocyte is the dominant cell in situ, few of them have passed through the Go-G1 interface and only a minority are truly activated. When lymphocytes from synovial tissue and fluid are studied in culture they proliferate weakly when stimulated and produce diminished amounts of interleukin-2 and gamma-interferon as compared with normal peripheral blood cells [15, 18] . These defective responses appear to result from specific inhibitors of interleukin-1, and perhaps interleukin-2 [18, 19] . The inhibitor(s) is likely derived from synovial fluid monocytes, perhaps reflecting an attempt to control the chronic immunologically mediated inflammation. A failure to demonstrate lymphokines of T cell origin in the rheumatoid arthritis joint is also consistent with this notion of T cell arrest. Interleukin-2, gammainterferon, and human interleukin-3 have each been looked for in synovial tissues and exudates without success [20, 21] ; whereas macrophage-derived factors are present in abundance (see next section). The absence of gamma-interferon is particularly noteworthy, since it is the conventional explanation for the abundant Ia surface molecules present on macrophages and intimal lining cells. Thus, the classic T cell model may require modification. At the very least, the information about T cell inhibitors must be incorporated, and perhaps alternative models need to be considered.\nAlthough it is usually assumed that the initiating agent in rheumatoid arthritis is responsible for both the early changes and the perpetuation of chronic inflammation, this need not be the case. Indeed there is reason to believe that the chronic rheumatoid lesion may be perpetuated in the absence of the inciting agent by immune responses to antigens quite distinct from those responsible for starting the process (Figure 4, right) . Such a scenario has been used to explain other chronic inflammatory processes, like chronic thyroiditis, during which it appears that an initial viral insult results in an appropriate localized immune response [22] . This response is characterized by infiltration into the lesion of T lymphocytes that elaborate lymphokines, especially interferon-gamma.\nInterferon-gamma induces Ia antigens on the surface of thyroid cells and these alone, or in combination with other surface molecules, are the antigens that become the target of autoimmune attack. The reaction between stimulator cells rich in surface Ia antigens and autologous T lymphocyte has been termed the autologous mixed leukocyte reaction (AMLR). It has been studied extensively as an in vitro correlate of autoimmunity. In addition, factors produced in the culture specimens can induce B cell proliferation and antibody formation [23] . Of interest are recent data in mice and humans suggesting that the cytokine milieu produced in the AMLR is nearly identical to that seen in rheumatoid synovitis. In contrast to allogeneic mixed leukocyte reactions, in which the culture supernatants contain a number of lymphokines, including interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma, very little of these lymphokines are found in the AMLR [24] . Although T helper cells proliferate, the responsible soluble factor has yet to be defined.\nA number of other observations favor the notion that rheumatoid arthritis represents a localized AMLR. The low level of Ia antigens on T cells in the synovium is consistent with this model insofar as in vitro autologous stimulation produces a relatively weak T cell response. The cytotoxic cells present in rheumatoid arthritis joint effusions are identical to the natural killer-like cells produced in the in vitro AMLR [25, 26] . But most important is the fact that the articular cavity and synovium contain a variety of potential stimulator cells. These include synoviocytes and synovial tissue macrophages that express high levels of surface class II antigens and Ia-rich dendritic cells, which constitute 5 to 10 percent of the mononuclear to Years Antigen I I Figure 4 . Schematic representation of the sev-era1 pathways that may be involved in the perpetuation of rheumatoid arthritis.\nConsequence cells in synovial fluid and are reported to be the most potent stimulators of mixed leukocyte reactions with blood cells [27] .\nThe AMLR model has a serious shortcoming, however, namely the requirement for the continuous expression of high levels of immune activation antigen on the cell surface of the stimulator population. The relative deficiency in the rheumatoid joint of interferon-gamma, the most potent inducer of Ia antigen, presents a problem. Unusual sensitivity of patients with rheumatoid arthritis to low levels of interferongamma has been excluded as an explanation [28] . Although synergy with other factors, like tumor necrosis factor or IL-4 is still possible, the most likely explanation is an alternative Ia antigen inducer (see next section). Another interesting, but unproven, possibility is that high levels of surface MHC molecules could be maintained through the action of an infectious agent that specifically induces Ia antigens on the surface of antigen-presenting cells [29] . Thus, a viral infection could act indirectly as an adjuvant to autologous stimulation without actually inducing a primary response toward itself.\nIn all the models proposed up to this point, T lymphocytes have been assigned the major role for the perpetuation of the rheumatoid inflammatory process. Presumably, the by-products of these cells spreading in a centrifugal fashion alter the endothelium of adjacent blood vessels, cause the proliferation and differentiation of nearby B cells, and directly influence the macrophages and synoviocytes in the lining above them. This scenario, however, is not consistent with the fact that most of the soluble products measured in synovial fluid or tissue supernatants appear to be produced by non-T cells [2, 21, . Thus, a third pathway needs to be considered, namely, that rheumatoid synovitis is driven by factors produced by neighboring macrophages and synovial fibroblasts in the joint lining that can influence one another in a resonating or paracrine manner (Figure 4, middle) . For instance, synovial fibroblasts, transformed to a \"rheumatoid phenotype\" might secrete factors that activate adjacent macrophages and induce increased amounts of Ia molecules on their surface membranes. Alternatively, macrophages activated in the periphery might enter the joint, home to the intimal lining, and stimulate adjacent synovial fibroblasts to proliferate and secrete deleterious products such as collagenase and prostaglandins [33] . Consistent with this third pathway is the demonstration that synoviocytes from rats given injections of complete Freund's adjuvant show biochemical and morphologic evidence of activation, including a fourfold increase in surface Ia antigen expression before the onset of arthritis or the appearance of mononuclear cells in the synovial membrane [341. Factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor, colony-stimulating factor-l, platelet-derived growth factor, and interleukin-6 are examples of potentially important factors made by fibroblasts, whereas interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor might be responsible for the macrophagedriven events. Each of these cytokines and growth factors has been identified within the rheumatoid joint.\nGranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor is particularly relevant. It alone among a number of mediators (including interleukin-1, -2, -3, -4, and -6, and colony-stimulating factor-l and tumor necrosis factor) consistently increases surface Ia antigen expression on normal blood monocytes. This effect of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor is additive with low concentrations of interferon-gamma and synergistic with tumor necrosis factor [35] . Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor is produced constitutively by rheumatoid synovial tissue cells, and the Ia antigen-inducing activity present in supernatants of cultured synovial tissue explants is neutralized by specific antibody to this cytokine [351. Thus., granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor IS probably the illusive, non-interferon macrophage-activating factor responsible for the high levels of Ia antigens in the intimal lining cells.\nA prediction of the transformed synoviocyte model is that T lymphocytes are not sequestered in the joint in response to a specific antigen; rather, they accumulate under the influence of factors made in the lining. Thus, there is no requirement that the T cells be anything more than innocent bystanders attracted by the inflammatory process, much like spectators at a fire. This would account for the minimal T cell activation and proliferation. Likewise, the abundant antibody production by B cells in the synovium would have to come about through T cell-independent mechanisms, perhaps under the influence of molecules such as interleukir$ or polyclonal activators. Furthermore, this model implies that the analysis of locally produced antibody or studies of the T cell antigen receptor are unlikely to provide clues to the origin of rheumatoid arthritis. Obviously, these three schemes do not encompass all of the pathogenetic mechanisms possible in rheumatoid arthritis; nor are they mutually exclusive. The ability of vascular endothelium and B lymphocytes to act as antigen-presenting cells or the interactions of mast cells and fibroblasts are examples of other potentially important interactions that have not been included. Likewise, it is an oversimplification to think that any of these pathways would operate in isolation. Products of synoviocyteimacrophage activation could well be responsible for down-regulating an appropriate immune response to a persistent antigen or switching the T cells in the interstitium to an autoreactive pathway against induced Ia antigens. A clear understanding of rheumatoid arthritis awaits identification of the initiating pathogen. Hopefully that will happen soon. Until that time, however, it will be necessary to expand our concepts beyond an analysis of T helper and suppressor subsets and their products if we wish to clarify the means by which various kinds of arthritis, with different clinical presentations, are perpetuated. Re-examination of classic notions about the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis may also prove helpful in designing new therapeutic interventions.\ndence suggesting that the inciting antigen might, indeed, persist in rheumatoid joints? Dr. Zvaifler: There certainly are animal models in which a rheumatoid arthritis-like condition is produced by persistent antigen. I have no objection to the notion that such a situation might prevail in rheumatoid arthritis. However, good evidence for this simply doesn't exist. Dr. Carsons: Would you comment on why the rheumatoid joint is so active in producing rheumatoid factors and other antibodies? Dr. Zvaifler: People are looking very hard at this questio?, and there are two general approaches. The conventional explanation is that T helper cells interact with B cells, causing them to elaborate immunoglobulin, but in such a scheme rheumatoid factors would be less likely to be produced in abundance. In terms of the Thl-Th2 paradigm derived from murine studies, this conventional explanation is in accord with activities of the Thl subset. A newer approach focuses on the Th2 subset, which on the basis of very incomplete evidence seems to drive B cells through a non-antigenspecific route, directly causing them to express their potential. This would seem to fit better with what we see in the rheumatoid joint. I'm afraid that as we clone more lymphokines we are facing the complexities that we saw with complement 20 years ago, namely, the problem of synergy. For example, interleukin-1 and interleukin-2 may be active only when you put them together. Interleukind and interleukin-6 do things to B cells that neither one alone will do. Gamma interferon's effect on Ia antigen induction is increased synergistically by tumor necrosis factor. There are many other examples. Dr. Paulus: Do you think that the lymphocytes in the synovium are driving the macrophages or that the macrophages are motoring on their .own? Dr. Zvaifler:\nMy own belief is that macrophages are motoring on their own.\nAre all of these lymphocytes just bystanders, then? Dr. Zvaifler:\nThey are not necessarily bystanders. I think that they have been summoned into the joint but are not allowed to express their potential because if they did, they would blow the joint away. We see in rheumatoid arthritis the body's ongoing attempts to control what could be a fiercely destructive process.\nIs there any evidence that one can down-regulate Ia antigen induction by using any of the disease-modifying antirheumatic agents? Dr. Zvaifler: Corticosteroids' effects on immune activation have been studied in mice. Dexamethasone has the ability to block interferon-gamma up-regulation of Ia antigens on the resting macrophage that already has some Ia. Dr. Fox: Prostaglandin E can be shown to down-regulate interleukin-1 production by macrophages, which, in turn, would down-regulate interferongamma production. I might also mention that physiologic doses of chloroquine have been shown to interfere with the assemblage of the beta-chain and the alpha-chain in HLA-DR, preventing the transport of HLA-DR to the cell surface. So, chloroquine offers an extremely rapid and physiologic way of interfering with any HLA-DR-related process, and the same should be true of hydroxychloroquine.\nSince both gold and hydroxychloroquine have been shown to accumulate in platelets and monocytes, this may be an important basic mechanism for reducing immune processing by the macrophage. Dr. Rynes; Dr. Zvaifler, how does your model fit in with the prevalence of the HLA-DR4 marker in patients with rheumatoid arthritis? Dr. Zvaifler: I cannot relate the two. At the same time, however, I don't doubt that the DR status is relevant to rheumatoid arthritis. It's unclear at this time, though, whether this has anything to do with susceptibility. I would point out that susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis is influenced by more than one gene, and whether HLA-DR may influence the initiation or the perpetuation of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown. We have examined the notion that susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritides may be due to ease of Ia antigen induction. Although there is a 2-log difference among normal persons in terms of the ability of interferon-gamma to induce Ia, so far there is no evidence that patients with rheumatoid arthritis show an unusual pattern in this respect; they are right down the middle, most responding, like 80 percent of normal people, to 1 to 10 units of interferon-gamma.",

Although often considered more of a nuisance than a disease, unrecognized and/or untreated pharyngitis can lead to serious suppurative and nonsuppurative complications.\nAcute bronchitis-the painful cough with sputum and possibly fever that develops after an upper respiratory infection-does not necessarily represent a bacterial infection. In contrast, persons with chronic bronchitis often experience episodes of acute infectious exacerbation of their condition, which may respond to antibiotic therapy.\nThe most serious of the respiratory tract infections is acute pneumonia. It is a fairly common cause of hospitalization among adults, accounting for 10 percent of adult hospital admissions per year. Acute pneumonia ranks sixth among all causes of death in the United States and should be considered a potentially fatal illness.\nPharyngitis can be caused by a number of etiologic agents, of which about a third are viral. In as many as 40 percent of cases, attempts to identify any specific agent-viral or bacterial-will be unsuccessful. From a therapeutic standpoint, the most important pathogen in pharyngitis is group A Streptococcus, which accounts for 10 percent to 30 percent of cases. Less common causes of pharyngitis, which may require specific isolation procedures or serologic assay, include Neisseria gonowhoeae (isolation requires Thayer-Martin medium), Corynebacterium hemolyticum (sore throat and skin rash), group C Streptococcus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Epstein-Barr virus (infectious mononucleosis). Diagnosis and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis are clearly indicated, for a number of reasons. Several prospective, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that treatment decreases duration of fever and other symptoms of sore throat due to streptococcal infection [l-4] . Treatment of streptococcal sore throat also contributes to controlling and reducing the spread of such infections within families and classrooms. Clinically, prompt and appropriate treatment prevents suppurative complications-not only can bacteria spread from the pharynx to the tonsils but also to the retro-and lateral pharyngeal spaces. Even meningitis was a not-uncommon consequence of streptococcal pharyngitis before the availability of antibiotic drugs. Finally, perhaps the best recognized reason to treat group A streptococcal infections is to prevent the development of acute rheumatic fever, which appears, after years of declining incidence, to be on the rise again in the United States.\nThe standard laboratory procedure for diagnosing pharyngitis is culture of a throat swab. If the culture result is positive for group A Streptococcus, the specificity of the test is high. On the other hand, the sensitivity of the test is not as high as most clinicians would like. Cultures of two sequential specimens, for example, taken from the same patient will show identical results only about 90 percent of the time [5] . Moreover, a study conducted by Saslow and colleagues [6] showed that 24 percent of throat culture specimens failed to reveal streptococcal infection that was later identified when the patients' tonsils were removed and examined. One of the most frustrating drawbacks of the culture method of diagnosis is the 24-to 36-hour delay before results are available. Delay also may compromise treatment efficacy; in one study, immediate institution of antibiotic drugs was associated with less incidence of morbidity than when treatment was delayed until culture results became available 131.\nFor these reasons, rapid tests for identifying streptococcal infection will soon become standard. Based on the use of an antibody to detect type-specific carbohydrate of group A Streptococcus in throat swabs (latex fixation or an enzyme-linked immunoassay), these tests can yield a diagnosis with both high specificity and high sensitivity within seven to 70 minutes.\nIn the absence of positive test results, the decision to treat a patient with pharyngitis is primarily based on clinical findings. Centor and colleagues ['7] have performed a decision analysis based on four clinical markers of streptococcal pharyngitis: tonsillar exudates; swollen, tender anterior cervical lymph nodes; fever or history of fever; and absence of cough. If all four features are present, the chance that the infection is streptococcal ranges from 26 percent to 65 percent; if only three of the four are present, the likelihood of streptococcal infection decreases to between 11 percent and 38 percent; if none of the features is present, the infection can be assumed to be nonstreptococcal in origin.\nThe setting, age, and contacts of the patients help determine whether the probability of streptococcal infection is at the lower or higher end of the range. An older person who has no contact with children, for instance, will have a much lower chance of contracting streptococcal infection than a preschool youngster, or a first-grade teacher.\nDecision analysis indicates that anyone with three or four clinical features indicative of streptococcal pharyngitis should be treated, without proceeding to a throat culture. If and when rapid tests become widely available, treatment without confirmation would be reasonable only when the prevalence of group A Streptococcus in the population at risk is at least 20 percent and the patient manifests all four streptococcal clinical features. In practical terms, the availability of a rapid test would virtually eliminate the question of whom to treat.\nRegimens of choice for treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis include oral penicillin for 10 days or a single, intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin G. The importance of taking the oral medication for the full 10 days to prevent nonsuppurative complications should be stressed to patients. Erythromycin is an appropriate alternative for penicillin-allergic patients. Other regimens, such as cefaclor or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, have been used effectively to treat streptococcal pharyngitis but offer no advantages compared with penicillin.\nFinally, although diagnosis and treatment of pharyngitis are usually straightforward, certain signs warrant immediate investigation. Respiratory difficulty, particularly stridor associated with sore throat in adults, may be indicative of epiglottitis due to Haemophilus influenxae.\nOther signs and symptoms of potentially dangerous clinical conditions include difficulty swallowing or handling secretions, severe pain without visible erythema, or a palpable mass in the pharynx. Blood in the pharynx or ear suggests an impending disastrous suppurative complication such as erosion in a carotid artery. Even untreated, the symptoms of streptococcal infection will disappear. Therefore,, persistence of symptoms for more than one week also warrants further evaluation.\nIn previously healthy persons, acute purulent bronchitis usually is not the result of a bacterial process. Rather, a productive cough, characterized by sputum, fever, and retrosternal pain on coughing, develops at the end of a typical upper respiratory tract infection. If the person is well with minimal systemic symptomology and has no underlying conditions, antibiotic treatment is generally unnecessary. Antibiotic therapy should be started, however, if cough productive of purulent sputum is protracted, and bacteria are seen on a Gram's stained preparation of the sputum. The choice of drugs is dictated by the findings on smear and culture specimens.\nA much more frequent and important type of bronchitis is acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. The classic definition of chronic bronchitis is almost daily production of sputum for at least three consecutive months and for two consecutive years. The origins of chronic bronchitis are cigarette smoking, inhalation of toxic substances, and possibly infection, although the role of infection usually is not clear.\nAcute infectious exacerbation of chronic bronchitis describes some combination of the following: a change in sputum color, consistency, or amount; increasing cough or dyspnea; chest tightness; and general fatigue without other systemic manifestations. If the patient presents with fever and chills, the diagnosis will probably be something other than simple acute infectious exacerbation.\nThe relationship between infection and exacerbation is sometimes difficult to determine. Potentially pathogenic bacteria can be isolated in most sputum specimens from persons with chronic bronchitis, even in the absence of symptoms of acute infectious exacerbation, Although it is true that Streptococcus pneumoniae is isolated in increased quantities when patients experience exacerbation [Sl, it is not clear in the SYMPOSIUM ON CEFIXIME / ELLNER Determination of the Cause of Pneumonia * Is the current condition accurately termed \"acute,\" or is it really chronic? Is it perhaps an acute illness superimposed on several months of progressive respiratory symptoms? * Is it community-or hospital-acquired? @ Who is the host? Young and healthy? Edlerly?

Presumably, these are the agents responsible for exacerbation. In another 25 percent to 50 percent of patients, the bronchitis will have a viral (influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus) rather than bacterial origin. Staphylococcus aureus (often following influenza) or enteric gram-negative rods are found in 5 percent to 10 percent of cases, and, occasionally, M. pneumoniae is implicated based on serologies.\nSince antibiotic treatment appears to decrease the incidence of morbidity and shorten time missed from work; it is indicated in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis [9, 10] .\nSeveral regimens have been proposed and tested based on the bacteriology of bronchitis. Although none has been shown to be clearly superior, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefaclor, erythro-my&n, tetracycline, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole appear to be effective.\nTo initiate appropriate, life-saving therapy for acute pneumonia, it is vitally important to establish its specific origin. Clues about the cause of pneumonia can be elicited by addressing a number of questions while obtaining the history and during the physical examination (Table I) \nIf the patient is young and otherwise healthy, he or she probably has infection with S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, or a viral pneumonia. On the other hand, an elderly person is more likely to have influenza or S. pneumoniae, which Osler dubbed \"the old man's friend.\" Elderly people, particularly those with refractory pneumonia, also may be infected with iVycobacterium tuberculosis, and in those older patients who are especially debilitated, a search for gramnegative eriteric organisms may be indicated.\nAspiration pneumonias and infections with possibly antibiotic-resistant S. aureus or gram-negative bacilli are a problem in hospitalized patients, particularly in those who have suffered seizures. Underlying alcoholism may predispose a person to S. pneumoniae or gram-negative organisms such as Klebsiella, whereas underlying diabetes increases the risk of infection with gram-negative enteric organisms or M. tubercu-SYMPOSIUM ON CEFIXIME I ELLNER losis. Patients with hemoglobinopathy, specifically children with sickle-cell disease, are particularly prone to infections with S. pneumoniae, H. influenxae, and M. pneumoniae.\nPossible causes of pneumonia in 'patients with chronic lung disease include S. pneumoniae, H. influenxae: Pasteurella multocida, gram-negative enteric bacilli, and M. tuberculosis.\nIt is important to determine where the patient lives and whether he or she has had contact with animals. Exposure to farm animals such as cattle, goats, and sheep, for example, may be associated with Q fever, bracellosis, or anthrax. Rabbit hunters may have tularemia and,exposure to birds can lead to psittacosis or histoplasmosis. People who live in semi-arid regions of the United States Southwest could have coccidioidomycosis, and those from areas around the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys could have histoplasmosis or blastomycosis. Armed services personnel,travelers, and visitors who have been in Southeast Asia may be ill with tuberculosis or melioidosis.\nThe patient with community-acquired purulent pneumonia classically presents with sudden pleuritic chest pain, productive cough with purulent sputum, high fever (up to 4o\"C), and profound shaking chills (rigors). Physical examination and chest radiograph reveal signs of lobar consoliddtion. The white blood cell count is elevated with an increase in circulating immature neutrophils, and lobar infiltrate is tonfirmed radiologically.\nAcute community-acquired purulent pneumonia is most commonly caused by S. pneumonia (50 percent to 90 percent). Depending on where the patient lives, 17 percent to 23 percent of these cases may be due to Legionella pneumophila, 2 percent to 18 percent to H. influenxae, and 2 percent to 10 percent to S. aureus. Anaerobes and non-Haemophilus gram-negative enteric organisms may also account for some of these community-acquired infections.\nThe initial diagnostic decision concerns whether the patient has acute purulent bacterial or nonbacterial pneumonia. The first step in establishing origin is obtaining a good, uncontaminated specimen for Gram's stain. If the sample is heavily contaminated with oral flora, it is unlikely to be useful and may be misleading. The adequacy of the specimen can be ascertained by the absence of squamous epithelial cells (less than five per high-power field), and the presence of neutrophils (10 to 15 per high-power field), as well as alveolar macrophages and bronchial epitheiial cells. Nasotracheal or transtracheal aspiration may be necessary to obtain a good specimen of loiver respiratory tract secretions. The presence of a predominant organism, particularly if found within white blood cells, suggests that it is pathogenic; aspiration pneumonia may be associated with multiple organisms.\nAlthough the Gram's stain may suggest that the cause of a pneumonia is not bacterial by the finding of inflammatory cells and no organisms, the clinical presentation can be even more useful for distinguishing a bacterial from a nonbacterial infection. Nonbacterial pneumonia usually begins less abruptly than bacterial pneumonia, with three or four days of symptoms. Constitutional symptoms rather than respiratory tract symptoms comprise the patients' chief com-SYMPOSIUM ON CEFIXIME/ELLNER plaints. The white blood cell count remains within normal limits. Importantly, the appearance on radiographic examination is much worse than would be anticipated based on physical examination. This constellation of symptoms suggests M. pneumoniae, adenovirus, Q fever, psittacosis, or L. pneumophila. A stain for acid-fast bacilli also is warranted because tuberculosis may present as an apparently nonbacterial pneumonia.\nOccasionally, patients with a more chronic set of respiratory symptoms will present with a nonlobar, unusual infiltrate that does not seem to fit the picture of a viral pneumonia. In this situation, it is particularly important to determine whether there are pockets of cavitation in the lesion. Although both Pneumococcus and Haemophilus can sometimes cause cavitation, its presence suggests tuberculosis, S. aureus, necrotizing infection due to gram-negative bacilli, or mixed anaerobic or fungal infection. Clearly, the finding of cavitation shifts the differential diagnosis of pneumonia as well as the antibiotic drugs that may be required for its treatment. Cavitation can also result from noninfectious sources, such as septic pulmonary emboli and carcinoma.\nBecause of the importance of recognizing necrotizing pneumonia as early as possible, investigators in Cleveland have been assessing the feasibility of a specific sputum test based on searching for elastin fibers in sputum [l&12]. Elastin fibers are found in the alveoli and terminal bronchioles; their presence in respiratory tract secretions, therefore, indicates a destructive process. These elastin fibers can be identified by dissolving the constituents of sputum with 10 percent potassium hydroxide. The presence of elastin fibers in sputum precedes both the development of cavities and the appearance of pulmonary infiltrates on radiographic examination of the chest. When the sputum test for elastin fibers is positive in an intubated or tracheostomized patient, its predictive value is 100 percent-the patient will progress to a full-blown nosocomial pneumonia [121.\nSince not all nosoeomial pneumonias are necrotizing, the sensitivity of the finding of elastin fibers is only 52 percent. The search for elastin fibers appears to be a generally useful adjunct for diagnosis not only in hospitalized patients but in all persons with pneumonia, particularly when symptoms do not fit the classic patterns of either bacterial or nonbacterial syndromes.\nClinicians managing patients with pneumonia should strive for specific treatment based on a definite origin of the illness. Nevertheless, when obtaining sputum or interpreting the Gram's stain is difficult, an empiric regimen may be necessary.\nPenicillin G is the drug of choice for S. pneumoniae, which remains exquisitely sensitive to that agent. Parenteral ampicillin would be appropriate treatment for infection with H. inzfluenxae, although beta-lactamase-producing H. inzfluenxae is presenting an increasing problem in adult patients. Initial treatment with a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole or a third-generation cephalosporin, therefore, is a prudent choice for a serious infection presumed to be caused by H. in.uenxae.\nS. aureus should be treated with a semisynthetic penicillin such as nafcillin. Anaerobes are exquisitely sensitive to penicillin, which is an appropriate starting regimen. If there is no clinical response, it may be useful to switch to a specific antianaerobic agent such as clindamycin. The finding of gram-negative enteric organisms on Gram's stain requires combination therapy with an aminoglycoside plus a third-generation cephalosporin. Choice of aminoglycoside should be based on the prevailing patterns of bacterial sensitivities in the hospital. Although penicillin remains a mainstay of therapy for many patients with bacterial pneumonia, the emergence of resistance should provide the impetus for discovery and testing of alternative therapies.\nAlthough L. pneumophila can be diagnosed by culture or serologies, confirmation usually requires days to weeks. A diagnosis based on clinical findings is necessary, therefore, and empiric treatment should be initiated. Erythromycin can be prescribed for suspected L. pneumophila as well as for ill. pneumoniae.\nWhen empiric therapy for a seriously ill patient is clearly indicated, combination regimens, such as an aminoglycoside plus a third-generation cephalosporin, will provide the broad-spectrum coverage that ensures efficacy against possibly resistant gram-negative organisms.\nIn summary, the management of any respiratory tract infection-whether relatively minor or lifethreatening-is most successful when an anti-infective agent is selected on the basis of a definite causative organism.",

    "title": "Acute bronchitis: Results of U.S. and European trials of antibiotic therapy",
    "body_text": "A cute bronchitis, an illness frequently encountered by primary-care physicians [1] , is an inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree that results from respiratory tract infection [2] . Viruses as well as bacterial respiratory pathogens have been implicated in the etiology of acute bronchitis. Unfortunately, however, the identification of specific causative agents has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining reliable sputum samples for culture [1, 3] ; as a result, there is considerable controversy regarding the best course of treatment for this condition.\nPatients with acute bronchitis that is suspected to be of viral origin are often treated with acetaminophen [4] and cough suppressants [3] for symptomatic relief. When bacterial origin is either suspected or documented, antibiotics are routinely used for treatment [1, 5] . Newer antibiotics are currently being tested to determine their efficacy against such illnesses as acute bronchitis. This article reviews the etiology and treatment of acute bronchitis as well as the safety and efficacy results of four clinical trials designed to compare a new fllactam antibiotic, loracarbef, with agents currently used as therapy for patients with this condition.\nPatients with acute bronchitis generally have a persistent cough that is usually accompanied by sputum production and occasionally by fever, chest pain, or both. These symptoms develop quickly and are usually preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Such factors as the age and general health of the patient, climate, exposure to air pollutants, and cigarette smoke contribute to the onset and severity of the illness [1, 3, 6] .\nThe etiologic agents most likely to cause bronchitis vary with the age of the patient. Viral pathogens include respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, and influenza virus [3] [4] [5] as well as adenovirus [3, 4] , coronavirus [3, 5] , and rubeola virus [3] . The extent to which bacterial infection is implicated in the development of acute bronchitis is controversial, in part because it is difficult to obtain sputum samples that are not contaminated with bacteria normally present in the nasopharyngeal tracts of healthy persons. Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that bacterial invasion may cause or prolong the illness.\nIt is now recognized that Mycoplasma pneumoniae [3, 5] and Bordetella pertussis [3] are potential primary etiologic agents of acute bacterial bronchitis. Common respiratory bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus may be responsible for secondary bacterial infections. Additional bacterial pathogens, such as Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis and Chlamydia psittaci, may also play a role in the development of acute bronchitis.\nTo date, there have been only five randomized, placebo-controlled trials conducted to assess the efficacy of antibiotic therapy in acute bronchitis [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Results of these trials were mixed. In addition, their significance is unclear because rigorous diagnostic criteria for sputum purulence, pathogen isolation, and pathogen susceptibility testing were not applied, and four of the five studies had small sample sizes. Nevertheless, two of the studies [7, 8] demonstrated a benefit for patients who received treatment: in both, symptoms improved and sputum production decreased, and in one, days lost from work also decreased [7] . Results of another study suggest that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the associated risk factors of dyspnea, increased sputum production, and sputum purulence constitute a subgroup of patients with acute bronchitis who derive the greatest benefit from antibiotic therapy [12] .\nIt has been estimated that >65% of patients with acute bronchitis are treated with antibiotics [1] . Historically, the most commonly used antibiotics have included erythromycin, tetracycline, and amoxicillin as well as ampicillin, trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole, and cefaclor [5] . Additional drugs are currently being developed to enhance the efficacy and improve the safety of treatment of these patients.\nLoracarbef, a member of the carbacephem class of fi-lactam antibiotics, is a new oral agent that can be administered twice daily. The carbacephems are chemically similar to the cephalosporins except that a sulfur atom has been replaced by a methylene group, which changes the dihydrothiazine ring of the cephalosporin nucleus to the tetrahydropyridine ring of the carbacephem nucleus. This substitution confers greater stability to the carbacephems [13, 14] . Loracarbef has activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens [13, 14] , including those thought to play a role in acute bronchitis.\nFour clinical trials (two in the United States, two in Europe) were initiated to study the relative effectiveness of loracarbef in treating acute bronchitis. Each trial was designed as a two-arm, randomized, parallel study comparing the efficacy of loracarbef with that of another antibiotic frequently used for treating acute bronchitis. The first study compared high-dose loracarbef (400 mg twice daily) with amoxicillin (500 mg three times daily) (Dere WH, unpublished data, 1991) . The second trial compared low-dose loracarbef (200 mg twice daily) with amoxicillin (500 mg three times daily) [Dere WH, unpublished data, 1991] . Of the remaining two trials, one compared low-dose loracarbef with the standard dose of cefaclor (250 mg three times daily) [15] , and the other compared high-dose loracarbef with the standard dose of amoxicillin/clavulanate (500/125 mg three times daily) [16] . All regimens were administered for 7 days.\nTo be enrolled in any of these four studies, patients were required to have a diagnosis of acute, purulent bacterial bronchitis. All of the patients had a cough that was productive of purulent sputum as confirmed by microscopic examination (>-25 white blood cells and <10 epithelial cells per highpower field). Furthermore, to ensure that the infection was acute, patients were required to have experienced a rapid onset of symptoms within 14 days of enrollment in the study. Patients who were diagnosed as having chronic bronchitis or who had an infiltrate on chest radiograph, renal impairment, or hypersensitivity to fi-lactams were excluded from these trials. Pregnant and nursing women were also not eligible.\nMore than 2,000 patients were enrolled in the four studies: a total of 538 received high-dose loracarbef, 561 received low-dose loracarbef, 244 received amoxiciUin/clavulanate, 159 received cefaclor, and 716 received amoxicillin [15, 16; Dere WH, unpublished data, 1991] . Many of the patients enrolled in these clinical trials did not qualify for clinical and bacteriologic evaluation; disqualification in most cases occurred because pretherapy evaluation of sputum cultures did not yield a known respiratory pathogen. Of 654 patients who were considered evaluable, 71% had pure or mixed cultures positive for one of the following four organisms: H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae ( Table |) .\nResistance of respiratory pathogens to the antibiotics used was uncommon in both treatment groups in all four studies (Table II) [15, 16; Dere WH, unpublished data, 1991] . These low rates of resistance to loracarbef, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and cefaclor were not unexpected; surprisingly, however, the level of resistance to amoxicillin, particularly of H. influenzae, although higher than for the other agents, was also relatively low. The explanation may likely be that the studies involving the amoxicillin treatment groups took place in Europe, where the prevalence ofH. influenzae resistance to amoxicillin is generally lower than it is in the United States [17] .\nTo determine the clinical and bacteriologic responses to antibiotic therapy, patients were evaluated within 3 days (posttherapy) and then 10-14 days (late-posttherapy) after the drugs were discontinued. The results of these studies are shown in Table II ] [15, 16; Dere WH, unpublished data, 1991] . From these data, it is clear that clinical and bacterial responses to both high-dose and low-dose loracarbef were virtually identical. In addition, loracarbef had comparable clinical and bacteriologic efficacy to each of the comparative agents.\nThe relative safety of loracarbef in comparison with the other antibiotics was also addressed in these studies. In the study comparing loracarbef with amoxicillin/clavulanate, a similar proportion of patients in each group reported experiencing nausea, vomiting, or both as well as rash or other cutaneous manifestations of hypersensitivity (Table IV) [16] ; the proportions of patients who discontinued therapy were also comparable. However, a significantly greater number of patients in the amoxi- Cephalothin disk was used to test susceptibility to cefaclor. mpicillin was used to test susceptibility to amoxicillin. Data from [15, 16; Dere WH, unpublished data, 1991] .\ncillin/clavulanate group reported experiencing diarrhea. In the study in which loracarbef was compared with cefaclor, the safety profiles of the two drugs were similar for all event categories ( Table  V) [15] . This was also true for adverse reactions reported by patients who received treatment with high-dose loracarbef, low-dose loracarbef, or amoxicillin (Table VI) [Dere WH, unpublished data, 1991] .\nIn summary, recent clinical trials designed to evaluate the use of loracarbef in treating acute bronchitis have shown that loracarbef had clinical as well as bacteriologic efficacy similar to that of the comparative drugs against such major respiratory pathogens as H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, ; Posttherapy evaluation occurred 3 days after therapy was discontinued; late posttherapy, 10-14 days after therapy was discontinued.\n\"Clinical success\" refers to elimination of or improvement in symptoms. ~b'Bacteriologic success\" refers to documented elimination or presumed elimination (in patients who had clinical success and a repeat culture was not possible or indicated--sputum production resolved) of the pathogen. \u00a7High-dose Ioracarbef = 400 mg twice daily; low-dose Ioracarbef = 200 mg twice daily.

    "title": "Clinical and Immunologic Responses in Patients with Viral Keratoconjunctivitis",
    "body_text": "Ocular viral infections manifest them selves in a variety of clinical pictures. Most commonly, the clinician finds follicular con junctivitis, with or without accompanying keratitis. Epithelial and subepithelial corneal infiltrates are frequently observed with adenovrrus mWnons. hut -also occur with hprppg simpW and nfhpr sriraijnduced kerajilis-ia&ctions. 1 ' 2 In addition to keratoconjunctivitis, viruses can (directly or in directly) cause deep ocular involvement, in cluding uveitis and optic nerve inflamma tion. 1 In an effort to learn more about the etiolo gies of ocular viral infections and the pathogenesis of viral keratitis, we studied two groups of patients with epidemic and nonepidemic viral infections. All of them had follicular conjunctivitis, and many suffered from keratitis during at least one stage of their illness.\nWe had three major goals: to determine the rate of viral recovery from cases of nonepidemic acute or subacute follicular conjunc tivitis; to compare the accuracy of clinical diagnoses with that achieved by culture or serologic studies, or both; and to explore the possible role of serum antibody in the forma tion and maintenance of corneal subepithelial infiltrates. We examined one group of patients who were involved in an epidemic caused by a single viral agent, and a second group of patients who were infected with many differ ent viruses. Our results indicate that a variety of agents can cause similar illness patterns, and that clinical observation cannot always distinguish one from another.\nFurthermore, serologic tests are a more accurate diagnostic method than clinical course in ocular viral illness, as is the case in systemic viral illnesses. Finally, viral anti body titers may correlate directly with spe cific clinical changes in adenovirus-induced keratoconjunctivitis.\nPatients-We studied two groups of pa tients by the following methods. The first was a population of 56 industrial employees who had epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. These patients were described in detail elsewhere, 8 but the data concerning their ocular findings were not presented.\nThe second group of 64 patients comprised a heterogeneous population seen during an 18-month period. The only criterion for se lection was follicular conjunctivitis. All but nine patients were seen in the emergency room, clinic, or staff offices at Barnes Hos pital from November 1971 to December 1972. The other nine were followed at the National Eye Institute from July 1970 to June 1971. One of us (H.L.S.K.) saw every patient during the acute or subacute phase of the illness and followed them until signs and symptoms abated. There were 32 males and 32 females, ranging in age from 3 to 77 years old (mean, 31.8 years). Twenty-nine patients were black, 33 were white, and two were orientals. All were ambulatory and in good health.\nCollection of virus culture specimens-Fifty-eight of the 64 nonepidemic patients had viral cultures. A cotton swab was rolled in the inferior cul-de-sac and transferred to a carrier medium (sodium chloride, potas sium chloride, dipotassium phosphate, char coal, and agar, pH 7.0). The contents of this tube were either stored at -70\u00b0C for a short period or immediately transferred to tissue culture tubes of human diploid fibroblast, primary human embryo kidney cell, or human epidermoid carcinoma. Stan dard culture methods have been described previously.* All viruses isolated in this initial attempt were passed and compared to ref erence prototype virus strains for indication of atypicality.\nThe methods for viral culture in the 56 epidemic keratoconjunctivitis patients have been described elsewhere. 3 A single patient was cultured for trachoma inclusion con junctivitis (TRIC) agent by other meth ods. 8 Serologic studies-Of the original 64 study patients, 13 did not return for a convalescent serum. Therefore these serologic results are based on 51 patients. We collected sera dur ing the acute phase and once or twice during the convalescent phase. There were two family groups in which a specimen from one uninf ected member was considered acute and another infected member's specimen was considered convalescent. We took a con valescent specimen from 34 of the 51 pa tients within 30 days of the initial visit; 14 within 60 days; and three patients had speci mens that were separated by more than 60 days.\nThe sera were tested for antibodies to the prototype strains of many respiratory and other viruses in order to survey all of the likely causes of follicular conjunctivitis (Table 1) . Complement-fixation, hemagglutination-inhibition, indirect hemagglutination, or serum neutralization tests were employed as appropriate for each particular virus. The sera were heat-inactivated (56\u00b0C, 30 minutes) for all serologic tests. Antibodies to influenza A, B, and C, parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3, mumps virus \"viral antigen,\" rubeola, respiratory syncytial virus (RS v), coronavirus OC-43 and 229E, herpes simplex 1, varicella, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bedsonia (TRIC agent), cytomegalovirus, and adeno virus group-specific hexon-antigen were as sayed by the standardized complement-fixa tion test with overnight fixation of 5 units of complement. 4 ' 8 Antibodies to influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, 4A, and 4B, Newcastle disease virus, mumps virus, rubeola, coronavirus OC-43, vaccinia, and adenovirus types 1 to 33 were assayed by the standardized hemagglutination-inhibition test with 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline diluent and spectrophotometrically standard ized 0.4% mammalian or 0.5% avian red blood cells. 7 Antibodies to coronavirus 229E were additionally measured by an indirect hemagglutination test. 8 Neutralizing anti bodies to rubeola, RS v, selected adenoviruses, the six coxsackie B viruses, echovirus types 4 and 9, and coxsackievirus A-10 were assayed by serum neutralization tests in human epidermoid carcinoma or monkey kidney tissue culture.' Neutralizing VOL. 80, NO. 4 VIRAL KERATOCONJUNCTIVITIS 663 antibody titers to vaccinia, herpes, coxsackievirus A-9, A-16, and A-21, and four strains of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis virus were similarly assayed by serum neutraliza tion tests in human diploid fibroblast tissue culture. Serum neutralization antibodies in coxsackievirus A-4 and A-7 were assayed in suckling mouse brain. 10 For diagnostic purposes a fourfold titer change (either rise or fall) was consid ered significant for any of the serologic tests. In addition a stable titer of > 1:32 in any serologic test (hemagglutination-inhibition, serum neutralization, or complement-fixa tion) suggested infection with that agent if the clinical course and other serologic tests were confirmatory.\nWhen serologic comparisons were carried out, as with the adenovirus groups described below, all of the testing was done in a stan dardized manner. We used only the hemag glutination-inhibition test, with 0.01 M phos phate-buffered saline and standardized mam malian or avian red blood cells, to compare adenovirus types. Antigens for types 1 to 33 were maintained at the Center for Disease Control and were used for similar serologic studies in the past. 7 Other serologic test re sults did not enter into the calculations for significance of titer levels. We tested all sera simultaneously and in duplicate with the same cell lots whenever possible so that test ing conditions and results would be equiv alent.\nClinical examinations-Those patients who had epidemic keratoconjunctivitis 8 were ex amined during the initial phase of their ill ness and approximately one month after res olution of all symptoms. Visual acuity was re corded and, by slit-lamp microscopy, we made a determination of presence or absence of subepithelial infiltrates. There was no at tempt to quantitate these or to judge sever ity.\nThe patients in the nonepidemic group were treated in a different manner. All pa tients were seen at least twice for evaluation of subjective and objective evidence of ocu lar illness. During each examination, we at tempted to document severity of symptoms, visual acuity, the presence of pre-auricular nodes (or other adenopathy), and the appear ance of the conjunctiva, cornea, and anterior chamber by slit-lamp microscopy. Detailed drawings of the cornea were made in keratitis cases, but the exact number of lesions was not recorded. Instead, we attempted to depict accurately the areas of cornea in volved for future evaluation. Each patient was followed until keratitis showed signs of stability or actual regression. When possible, those patients with persistent lesions were followed for a longer time period.\nAt the end of the study period, all of the drawings were re-examined. For each pa tient we estimated the percentage of cornea involved with infiltrates during the peak phase of the illness. We assigned values be fore the serologic data were available. When all of the serologies were complete, the adeno virus groups were investigated separately. We calculated the severity of keratitis vs. sero logic titer by hemagglutination-inhibition test values and the percentage of corneal involve ment arrived at previously.\nTherapeutic regimen-Almost all of the patients were treated with topical antibiotics, compresses, or astringents. Two of the pa tients in the adenovirus group received \u00ab corticosteroids after cessation of the acute phase and when visual acuity decreased. Pa tients in the herpes group were given various antiviral preparations. Although these were generally effective in controlling the acute disease, we did not attempt statistical corre lations to determine efficacy.\nAncillary studies-We took swabs for rou tine bacterial cultures in 26 nonepidemic pa tients simultaneously with the viral cultures. Although most of these were taken at ran dom, occasionally patients presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of bacterial conjunctivitis complicating the viral illness; these patients were cultured specifically to identify possible infectious agents. In addi tion, conjunctival scrapings were examined 664 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY OCTOBER, 197S in 27 patients. These were processed with Giemsa or Gram stains, or both.\nTear studies-Tears were collected from ten patients with acute and chronic, nonepidemic viral infections or chronic noninfectious conjunctivitis. The details for collect ing, processing, and quantitating immunoglobulins in tears have been described pre viously. 11 ' 12 The viral serologic studies on the tear specimens were similar to those done on the sera from these individuals, but the tear specimens were not heat-inactivated and were diluted starting at 1:2 instead of 1:8. (Other studies involving the epidemic keratoconjunctivitis group have been de scribed previously. 8 )\nAlthough more than 90% of the infected eyes were cultured, the yield of positive viral cul tures was low. Table 2* shows the difference between the number of positive isolates ob tained by culturing before or after the eighth * All of the data for the epidemic keratoconjunc tivitis group were published elsewhere, except for the corneal quantitative material in clinical studies.' day of illness. Culturable virus tended to dis appear after the first week of illness in most of the virus groups examined.\nAdenovirus isolates (types 3, 7a, 8, and 16) were typical prototype-like strains but three of the adenovirus type 7a viruses were not; these were neutralized or inhibited less well with prototype reference antisera than with the patient's own convalescent serum. 18 This was not clinically significant.\nSerologic studies (nonepidemic patients)-Since positive viral cultures were sparse, the restrospective study of acute and convales cent sera constituted the major means of diag nosis. If cultures were positive or if clinical evidence pointed to a specific diagnosis-the presence of herpetic dendrites-the total bat tery of serologic tests (Table 1) was not al ways carried out.\nWe compared the clinical and serologic diagnoses in the 51 patients whose sera we examined (Table 3 ). All patients with posi tive cultures showed the expected serologic changes. Two patients appeared to have ex perienced infections with two agents, either simultaneously or in close temporal proxim ity. In one patient, the hemagglutination-inhibition titer to adenovirus type 7 was stable at 1:128, indicating a recent infection; at the same time, the culture for TRIC agent was positive. 8 The second patient had an ill ness characterized by initial upper respiratory infection and secondary chronic uniocular keratitis, with comeal ulceration and recur rences. Over the three months of observation during the chronic phase, he developed a gradual fourfold rise in adenovirus type 7 hemagglutination-inhibition antibody (1:32 to 1:128). Almost eight months after his initial illness he demonstrated signs of an terior uveitis after an upper respiratory ill ness (nonspecific) and increased his herpes simplex antibody titer fourfold (1:32 to 1:128) in both complement-fixation and serum neutralization tests. These data sup port a premise of double infections in both patients.\nFive additional patients demonstrated sero-VOL. 80, NO. 4 VIRAL KERATOCONJUNCTIVITIS 665 logic changes suggestive of either sequential or simultaneous infection with two or three agents. However, in these patients we could not differentiate clinically among the various agents. Therefore, the serology that best fitted the clinical picture and time sequence of infection was chosen as the final diagnosis.\nMost of the clinical misdiagnoses were made in the cases of presumed epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. Adenovirus type 7 was the most prominent masquerader, and herpes simplex passed for epidemic keratoconjunctivitis in one case.\nWe listed the geometric mean titers for the major adenovirus groups encountered in this study in Table 4 . Although the average fold-rise in geometric mean titers was simi lar, the final absolute titers were different by more than twofold. This difference was sta tistically significant.\nIn an attempt to explain the higher final titer of the Group 1 adenovirus-infected pa tients, we looked at two different factors. The first was a consideration of a possible differ ence in the acute and convalescent phase se rum samples ( Table 5 ). The two groups were similar in makeup in that nine of 16 Group 1 patients and ten of 13 Group 2 were examined during the acute phase of their illness: they showed a fourfold rise in their titer to the infecting adenovirus.\nThere was a moderate disparity between patient history and the serologic data. Three Group 1 patients (Cases 8,9, and 10) claimed they were ill for a few days, but their titer reflected a long-term illness (> 32 initial or no change with time, or both). We ob served one patient (Case 8) with an un changing 1:16 titer throughout his illness, and we could not explain the lack of change in titer. This disparity was less evident in Group 2 (Case 26).\nThe difference in acute phase geometric titer for each group was nearly significant .05 < P < .06). However, when we con sidered only patients proven to be in the acute phase, the difference was not signifi cant (5.6 vs. 9.3; P > .1). There was a difference in the number of days between acute and convalescent samples for the two groups. Overall, the mean num ber of days was 21 for Group 1 and 29 for Group 2 (not significant). However, if only the 19 patients in the acute phase were again considered, the averages were 19 days and 32 days, respectively (P <.05; t = 2.34; df, 17). (From these data, a higher titer should have been expected for Group 2 be cause of the longer interval between acute phase and serum peak.) Thus, neither the titer of acute phase sera nor the sampling time of convalescent phase sera seemed to ac count for the difference in final antibody levels.\nWe also considered the degree of upper respiratory or generalized illness among pa tients in both groups. Of the 21 patients with serologic evidence of Group 1 infection, only 16 gave accurate histories; nine of these reported an associated upper respiratory in fection with conjunctivitis. In contrast, one (with adenovirus type 9) of the 13 patients in Group 2 exhibited signs or symptoms of upper respiratory infection. This differ ence was again significant (P < .01, \\ 2 test).\nThus, those with Group 1 nonepidemic adenovirus infection were afflicted with more upper respiratory infections, but these in- fections were not necessarily responsible for the significantly higher serologic titers. In fact, there was no significant relationship be tween the presence of an upper respiratory infection and a serologic response that equaled or exceeded 1:128 (Table 6 ). This negative correlation held true for changes in both homologous and heterologous virus titers. Therefore, the explanation for the higher serum titers in patients with Group 1 infections may not be related directly to the concomitant upper respiratory infections.\nWe compared the sensitivity of the two most commonly employed serologic tests (Table 7) . Hemagglutination-inhibition tests demonstrated fourfold rises in many cases where complement-fixation tests failed to show significant changes. Hence, primary de pendence on the usual complement-fixation hexon-antigen test would have resulted in fewer positive diagnoses, even in acute infec tions.\nAncillary laboratory studies (nonepidemic patients)-We microscopically examined conjunctival smears from 21 patients, and routine bacterial cultures were taken from 11 of these patients plus ten other individuals. Cultures from five patients showed coagulasepositive staphylococci; these patients had various diagnoses: adenovirus type 8 epi demic keratoconjunctivitis, adenovirus type 7 pharyngoconjunctival fever, herpes sim plex keratitis, and a case of chronic \"fac titious\" conjunctivitis.\nThe smears were helpful only in cases of herpetic infections. In three patients with herpes simplex and one with herpes zoster, 3 Twenty-eight patients showed signs of keratitis during their illness and had chronic subepithelial infiltrates when examined one month after resolution of their illness (16 of these experienced some degree of decreased visual acuity as well). The 28 remaining patients, who were also infected during the first wave of the epidemic were seen at the same time and had no subepithelial infiltrates. The peak geometric mean hemagglutination-inhibition titer of the for mer group with residual infiltrates was 1:34.5 (range 1:10 to 1:160). The data for the un affected group were 1:102.5 geometric mean titer (range 1:20 to 1:320). This difference was significant (P < .001). (The collection of sera and intervals between examinations were similar for patients because they were part of an epidemic group. 3 The serologic tests were exactly the same as those carried out in the nonepidemic group, and often were done simultaneously t Estimated maximum percent of cornea with epithelial or subepithelial infiltrates. * Titers did not change significantly (> fourfold) during the observation period (compare with Table 5) analysis of corneal disease. Group 1 was composed of five patients with adenovirus type 3 and 11 patients with adenovirus type 7 infections. Group 2 contained 11 patients with adenovirus type 8 and one each with adenovirus type 9 and adenovirus 29. The data concerning the corneal involve ment and antibody levels of both groups were compiled (Table 8, compare with Table 5 ). Analysis by x 2 testing showed several sig nificant correlations. First, the number of eyes involved with corneal changes differed significantly in the two groups. In Group 1, there were five patients with no involve ment, seven with one eye, and four with both eyes affected. Group 2 had only one patient without corneal changes, three pa tients with a single eye involved, and nine patients with both eyes involved (x 2 = 5.94; df, 2; PS2.05). When this same factor VOL. 80, NO. 4\n(number of eyes) was used, and the antibody levels were compared for all adenovirus infections (Groups 1 and 2) , a more signifi cant difference was noted. At a level of 1:64, there were 12 doubly involved patients, four with one eye, and three with no corneal in volvement. At a level of 1:128, only one pa tient showed infiltrates in both eyes, six had single eye involvement, and three had no ocu lar involvement. The difference between the number of patients in these three categories proved to be statistically significant (x 2 = 7.65;df,2;P<.025).\nCorrelations of the degree of corneal in volvement with antibody level were also car ried out. There was no difference between the two groups in the number of patients with central lesions vs. peripheral lesions of the cornea. This was reflected in the patients with decreased visual acuity (Table 8) .\nWe devised a comparison of the two groups in terms of fold-rise in antibody titer (Fig  ure) . (The fold-rise was a reflection of the rate of antibody production as well as the amount of antibody.) As evidenced by the graph, the responses of the two groups were almost diametrically opposed. For each foldrise in titer, the Group 1 patients had pro gressively less corneal involvement. For the same change in titer, the Group 2 patients showed progressively more corneal infiltra tion. However, the final level of antibody achieved was lower in Group 2 (compare with Table 4 ).\nA similar difference in the two groups was noted at the 40% level of corneal infiltration. Only two patients (of 16) in Group 1 had infiltrates that involved > 40% of the corneal surface area. In Group 2, six of 13 patients were affected in the same way ( x 2 = 5.73; df, 1; P<.025).\nFinally, age was not a factor differentiat ing the two groups. The average age of Group 1 patients was 29.9 years; Group 2 patients averaged 30.5 years. The difference was not statistically significant (t = .128; df, 25).\nA comparison of the percent corneal involvement with fold-rise in antibody titer among patients infected with Group 1 (AV 1) and 2 (AV 2) adenoviruses. r represents the correlation coefficient of the least-squares line calculated to fit the data. Only patients with at least a fourfold rise are included. GROUP)-Rises in titers to heterologous vi ruses were observed in Groups 1 and 2 infec tions. Thus, in patients infected with adeno virus type 7 (Group 1), a significant change in titer to this agent occurred, as well as smaller changes to such related types as 3, 11, and 21 (Table 8 ). However, rises in heterologous titers were more consistently seen in patients with Group 2 infections. For example, adenovirus type 8 infections produced rises to 12 related viral types in the Group 2 series. This was reflected in the higher heterologous average titers (Table  8 ). In particular, we noted a tendency for heterologous responders within family groups. In one of these families, all of the blood relatives showed changes in titer to several other Group 2 subtypes after adeno virus type 8 infection. However, the spouse of one member, exposed to the same virus, had a serologic change to adenovirus type 8 alone (homologous responder). 670 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY OCTOBER, 1975 We observed patients with keratoconjunctivitis from other causes during this study (Table 3) , but only adenovirus patients formed homogenous groups that lent them selves to statistical analysis. The herpes group was large (eight herpes simplex, two herpes zoster, two possible mixed herpes simplex-zoster, and three presumed cytomegalovirus), but heterogenous in terms of acute and chronic illness, treatment with var ious antiviral drugs or corticosteroids, and poor serologic responses. Variability in his tory, follow-up, and other factors occurred among the patients with adenovirus so the number of patients who met the criteria for various analyses often differed from one test to another. In terms of treatment, however, almost all of the patients with adenovirus required only therapy with topical vasocon strictors or antibiotics, or both. Only two patients (one each from Groups 1 and 2) required corticosteroids for symptomatic re lief, and this was instituted after achieving maximum corneal scores.\nAnalysis of tears-Ocular external secre tions (tears) were analyzed in ten patients. In general, there were low antibody titers. Four patients with serologic diagnoses of herpetic infection represented chronic, re current keratoconjunctivitis or kerato-uveitis. Only one patient with disci form keratitis and uveitis had detectable tear-borne neutralizing antibody to herpes simplex. His serum titer, however, was not greater than 1:8 in a simul taneous neutralization test. One other patient showed tear antibody to herpes zoster and se rologic changes consistent with simplex. Whether this represented true simultaneous infection or the presence of cross reaction was not determined.\nTwo patients had high titers (1:8, 1:16) to coronavirus OC-43 in their external secretions. Upper respiratory infection has produced antibody in tears 11 and this may represent that kind of relationship.\nThe predominant immunoglobulin species in the tears was IgA, in agreement with pre vious work. 11 ' 12 However, we made no at tempt to prove that the measurable hemagglutination-inhibition or serum neutralization antibodies were unique to IgA. DISCUSSION Because all patients in the second part of this study were seen during a nonepidemic time period, the cases of keratitis were varied in their etiologies (Table 3 ). This observa tion agrees with previous studies that de scribed a similar variety of viral agents re sponsible for epidemic keratoconjunctivitis keratitis. 16 \" 18 The behavior of the individual viral infec tions also conformed to expected patterns. Thus, Group 1 adenoviruses caused more upper respiratory and generalized illness, but less keratitis, than Group 2 infections. 1 ' 2 - [19] [20] [21] Herpes viruses caused more severe keratitis and kerato-uveitis, but clinical illnesses cor related poorly with serologic changes in anti body titer. 28 ' 23 We also encountered difficulty in culturing any virus after seven to ten days of symptoms. This has been reported before for epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, but it is probably true for many other viral syndromes. 2,24- 28 We, like others, also found the hemagglutination-inhibition test to be supe rior to complement-fixation as a serum diag nostic procedure in adenovirus infection. 16 No procedure gave consistent results with tears.\nThere were differences in the extent of corneal involvement observed in Group 1 and 2 infections. The correlations indicate that Group 2 viruses produced a lower level of specific antibody titer (despite a longer time interval between the collection of acute and convalescent sera), and induced more corneal disease in the affected indi viduals.\nThese data suggest that the higher anti body titer in Group 1 protected the cornea, supported by examination of the keratocon junctivitis epidemic of adenovirus type 8, a Group 2 virus. In the latter patients, a range of antibody was observed that was somewhat higher than that of the nonepidemic Group 1. (The reason for this difference is not readily apparent, but does not lie in testing differences, since both sets of sera were ex amined under identical conditions and often simultaneously.) What is more important, however, is the range of corneal involve ment with this single viral agent. Once again, the patients with higher antibody titer ex perienced less corneal involvement with this usually virulent agent. 17 ' 19 The corneal infiltrates may only represent a pattern of infection and the antibody re sponse to it. Certainly more than one viral type can cause this pattern, as shown in the nonepidemic group. Also, the same virus can cause different degrees of involvement (epi demic study), perhaps depending on the level of antibody illicited by the infection.\nSince delayed hypersensitivity was not spe cifically assayed, the elevated humoral anti body in epidemic Group 2 or nonepidemic Group 1 patients may reflect a higher degree oi overall immunity, and cellular immunity may be the chief deterrent of corneal dis ease. However, systemic antibody alone may protect the cornea (and even the fellow eye) from severe involvement. Whether it was humoral or cellular, or both, the nonepidemic and epidemic groups of patients displayed a reasonably similar pattern of protection that correlated with high antibody titer.\nWe only speculate about the pathogenesis of the subepithelial infiltrates. In studies of immune-complex disease, for instance, rheu matoid arthritis and Aleutian mink disease, antigen-antibody complexes in blood vessel walls can attract complement and inflamma tory cells that cause the damage. 87 ' 88 These complexes are made to persist by maintain ing a low titer antibody, and the disease may be completely eliminated by raising the titer. 88 The cornea is similar to the collagenous tis sue in the walls of blood vessels, 29 and these tissues can absorb certain antigens. 80 ' 81 Therefore, it seems feasible that viral par ticles might be bound to the stromal collagen, form complexes with low levels of antibody diffusing within the cornea, and thereby act as a nidus for inflammation. The subsequent fixation of complement and attraction of in flammatory cells completes the subepithelial infiltrate seen by slit-lamp microscopy. Corticosteroids would disrupt the inflammatory response, but it would not remove the com plexes. Hence, discontinuation of the drug would allow inflammatory cells to reappear. 88 A similar set of circumstances was proposed in the pathogenesis of stromal disease in herpes simplex keratitis. 88 Based on these suppositions, one may con clude that the sometimes permanent visual damage observed in epidemic keratoconjunctivitis might be decreased or eliminated by enhancing the immune response of the in fected patient, perhaps during the acute in fection.\nOf 120 individuals suffering from follicular conjunctivitis, with or without keratitis, 56 had epidemic keratoconiunctivitis caused by adenovirus type 8. The remaining 64 pa tients had keratoconjunctivitis produced by several different viruses, including herpes simplex, adenoviruses types 3, 7, 8, 16, 21, and 29, and others. Positive viral cultures were difficult to obtain after the first week of illness in most viral infections. Serologic tests were far more successful in identifying causative agents. Hemagglutination-inhibition tests in adenovirus infections proved to be fast, accurate, and more sensitive than other serologic tests. Among the epidemic and nonepidemic adenovirus groups, the de gree of corneal involvement in the infections appeared to be correlated with the level anti body against the infectious agent. Patients with low antibody titers had more severe keratitis than those with high titers. This correlation was true for both the epidemic and nonepidemic patients.",

    "body_text": "Laurie acid (LA),' like prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes, is hydroxylated at the w and (w-l) positions by microsomal preparations isolated from both hepatic and extrahepatic tissue (l-6). The participation of cytochrome P-450 in LA metabolism has been demonstrated directly, in in vitro reconstituted cytochrome P-450 systems (7-9) and, indirectly, with the use of cytochrome P-450 inducers and inhibitors ( lo-12). These inhibitors and inducers have also been used to demonstrate that different cytochrome P-450 isozymes support the hydroxylation of LA at the o and (w-l) positions.\nSome of the earliest techniques that were ' Abbreviations used: LA, lauric acid; PG, prostaglandin; UDYA, IO-undecynoic acid; SK&F 525-A, 2diethylaminoethyl-2,2-diphenylvalerate hydrochloride; ACN, acetonitrile; PGE, prostaglandin E. utilized to assay microsomal LA hydroxylase activity included radio-gas chromatography (1, 2) and radio-thin-layer chromatography (8) . However, many of these techniques did not provide sufficient resolution for quantitation of the individual w-and (w-l)-hydroxylated metabolites of LA (8, 12) . One of the most popular methods for quantitation of LA and its metabolites involves HPLC separation and radiochemical quantitation of the methyl esters of LA and its hydroxylated metabolites (13) . This procedure has numerous steps and is therefore time consuming and subject to variability. Two groups have recently reported a simplified procedure for the quantitation of microsomal LA hydroxylation ( 11, 14) . This procedure involves HPLC separation of underivatized LA and the wand (o-1 )-hydroxylated metabolites. ROMAN0 ET AL.\nRecent data suggest that each hydroxylation reaction is catalyzed by a different isozyme(s) of cytochrome P-450 (12) . Therefore, quantitation of the individual metabolites of LA could be used for the characterization of a different isozyme(s) of cytochrome P-450. Studies by Kupfer and co-workers indicate that, in addition to hydroxylation at the w and (w-l) positions, hepatic microsomes also catalyze the hydroxylation of PGE, and PGEz at the (w-2) position ( 15, 16) . Therefore, it is feasible that other lipids such as LA could also be hydroxylated at the (o-2) position by microsomal incubations. In this paper, we describe a technique which allows rapid separation and quantitation of three microsomal metabolites [w-, (w-1 )-, and (o-2)-hydroxy] of LA. Furthermore, we describe an initial biochemical characterization of the three microsomal LA hydroxylases. St. Louis, MO) and water were available ad libitum. Rats were quarantined at least 2 weeks prior to use. Unfasted rats were killed by cervical dislocation and organs were excised immediately.\nMicrosomes were prepared as reported (17) and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. Protein concentrations were determined according to Gornall et al. (18) .\nAssay conditions. Reaction vessels contained microsomal protein (0.3-0.6 mg/ml), MgClz (5 mM), [r4C]lauric acid (0.1 IIIM, 10 mCi/mmol) and a regenerating system consisting of glucose 6-phosphate ( 12.5 mrvi) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (2.2 units/ml) dissolved in 1 ml of Tris-HCI (0.05 M), pH 7.5. For inhibition experiments, SK&F 525-A and metyrapone were dissolved directly in a small volume of Tris-HCl prior to addition to incubations;\n(Ynaphthoflavone was dissolved in acetone and coated on the walls of the incubation vessel, and the solvent was evaporated prior to addition of the microsomal suspension. After 1 min of preincubation, the reaction was started by addition of 1 pmol of NADPH. Samples were incubated for 10 min in a shaking water bath maintained at 37\u00b0C. Incubations were terminated with 0.4 ml of 10% H2S04. The acidified incubation mixture was extracted twice with 3 ml of fresh ether and the ether was evaporated under nitrogen at 30\u00b0C. The dried residue was resuspended in 250 ~1 of 67.5% ACN in 1% acetic acid. Extraction recovery was determined by counting 10 ~1 of the resuspended sample in 5 ml of Atomlight. Recovery of radioactivity from incubation mixtures was greater than 95%.\nQuantitation of LA and metabolites. LA and metabolites were separated on an HPLC system consisting of two Model 5 10 solvent delivery systems, a Model 720 system controller, and a Model 7 10B WISP autoinjector (Waters Assoc., Inc., Milford, MA) equipped with a model IC Flo-One Beta radiochemical detector (Radiomatic Instruments) outfitted with a 0.4-ml liquid flow cell. Quantitation was carried out with a S-pm Altex (Beckman Inst., Berkeley, CA) Cls column (4.6 X 250 mm) by gradient elution with acetic acid ( 1%) and ACN. Following injection of sample (25 pl), the percentage of ACN was held at 36% for 14 min, then increased linearly to 90% over 4 min, and held at 90% for 3 min prior to reequilibration.\nThe flow rate was maintained at 1.5 ml/min throughout the analysis. The scintillant (FLO-SCINT II) to HPLC effluent ratio was maintained at 3: 1, which provided a counting efficiency of 94%. Gradient conditions did not affect counting efficiency by greater than 5%. The recovery of radioactivity from the column was 97 + 1.2%.\nIsolation and identljication of LA metabolites. Hydroxylated metabolites of LA from the combined extracts of 20 incubations were separated on a 5-pm Altex (Beckman Inst.) Cl8 column (10 X 250 mm) by gradient elution with acetic acid (1%) and ACN. Following injection, the percentage of ACN was held at 36% for 25 min, then increased linearly to 90% over 2 min, and held at 90% for 2 min prior to reequilibration.\nThe flow rate was maintained at 3.5 ml/min throughout the analysis. Fractions were collected every 0.3 min. The radiochemical content of each fraction was determined and samples containing metabolites were evaporated under reduced pressure. The compounds were methylated with 250 ~1 of ethereal diazomethane, dried under nitrogen, and resus-pended in hexane. Each metabolite was further purified by thin-layer chromatography; methylated metabolites were applied to silica gel TLC plates (Whatman, Hillsboro, OR) which were developed in hexane:ether:acetic acid, 70:30: 1.5 (v/v). The plates were scanned with a Berthold Model LB 2832 TLC analyzer and the area corresponding to the radioactive peak was isolated and extracted twice in ether. The ether was dried under nitrogen and metabolites were resuspended in 5 ~1 of ACN and 5 ~1 of N,Obis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide containing 1% trimethylchlorosilane and were heated at 60\u00b0C for 35 min. Mass spectra of the trimethylsilyl ether methyl ester of each metabolite was obtained on a Finnigan 4500 gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (Finnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with a bonded phase fused silica capillary column (30 m X 0.32 mm, DB-5,0.25-grn film, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA) and an on-column injector which was maintained at room temperature. Following injection, the oven temperature was held at 50\u00b0C for 2 min, increased ballistically to lOO\"C, and then increased 4\"C/min to 250\u00b0C.\n[14C]LA, in the presence of NADPH, resulted in the formation of three metabolites ( Fig. 1 A) . These metabolites were not formed when NADPH was omitted from the incubation mixture (Fig. 1B) (Fig. 2C ). On the basis of C-value and mass spectra, metabolite I was identified as 11 -hydroxylauric acid [(w-l)hydroxylauric acid]; metabolite II was identified as IO-hydroxylauric acid [(w-2)-hydroxylauric acid] and metabolite III was identified as 12-hydroxylauric acid (w-hydroxylauric acid).\nResolution of the three microsomal metabolites of LA by flow-through radiochemical detection was dependent upon flow cell size and the scintillant to HPLC effluent ratio. By maintaining the scintillant to HPLC effluent ratio at 2:l and varying flow cell size it was possible to obtain baseline resolution of all three metabolites (Fig. 3) . Peaks I and II could not be resolved with a 2.5 ml flow cell; some resolution of these peaks was observed when a 1.0 ml flow cell was used. With the larger flow cells, some improvement in resolution was obtained by increasing the scintillant to HPLC effluent ratio from 2: 1 to 4: 1 (Fig. 4) . Quantitation of the three LA metabolites by flow-through radiochemical quantitation provided linear results over the ranges (0.375-26 nmol/ml) most ofien encountered in in vitro studies (Table 1) . At a specific activity for [ 14C]LA of 10 mCi/mmol, the effective limit of quantitation for each metabolite (assuming a 25-~1 injection) was approximately 0.25 nmol/ml. Below these concentrations, the variability of results (CV >20%) obtained was too great to allow quantitation of each metabolite.\nIn practical terms, rates as low as 12.5 pmol/mg protein/min can be accurately determined using standard assay conditions (10 min, 0.5 mg/ml, fourfold concentration following extraction). If metabolite formation was expected to be below this limit of quantitation, the specific activity of LA was increased to reduce the variability observed in quantitation of the metabolites or a larger volume was injected on column (volumes up to 75 ~1 could be injected without a noticeable decrease in resolution).\nThe formation of all three metabolites of LA by microsomal incubations was linear relative to time of incubation and protein concentration (Fig. 5) . The formation of all three metabolites could be supported by NADPH added directly or by NADPH generated from glucose 6-phosphate (Table 2 ) or isocitric acid (data not shown) regenerating systems. However, certain glucose 6-phosphate regenerating systems (Sigma) resulted in substantially less microsomal metabolism of LA when compared to the metabolism supported by NADPH alone (Table 2 ). This inhibition of LA hydroxylases was due to an inhibitor present in the glucose 6-phosphate. Glucose 6-phosphate from other sources (Fluka, Boehringer-Mannheim) did not inhibit LA formed were markedly different from those hydroxylases. The microsomal metabolism of formed in the presence of NADPH. Very little LA could also be supported by hydrogen per-w-hydroxy-LA was formed while the formaoxide ( Table 3 ). The formation of all three tion of the (w-l)-and (w-2)-hydroxylated melauric acid metabolites increased as the con-tabolites was similar to that supported by centration of Hz02 was increased in the incu-NADPH alone (Table 3) with metyrapone resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction of LA (w-l)-and (w-2)-hydroxylases; at 10m3 M, inhibition of both enzyme activities was approximately 60%. In contrast, metyrapone resulted in very little inhibition (~10%) of LA w-hydroxylases.\nThe acetylenic fatty acid, 1 0-undecynoic acid (UDYA), was also employed as a biochemical tool for dissociating LA hydroxylase activities. Preincubation of microsomes for periods up to 1 h resulted in a small (lo-20%) increase in all LA hydroxylase activities when compared to nonpreincubated controls. This increase in hydroxylase activities is unexplained but may reflect metabolism, during the preincubation period, of lipids which are released from the microsomal membrane and inhibit LA hydroxylases. Rat liver microsomes contain 2-2.5 nmol of free fatty acids, both saturated and unsaturated, per milligram of microsomal protein (19, 20) . As postulated by Kupfer and others, the amounts and ratios of these fatty acids may affect cytochrome P-450-dependent activities such as LA hydroxylases (2 1). Preincubation of microsomes with UDYA resulted in a time-dependent loss of LA W-, (w-l)-, and (w-2)-hydroxylase activities (Fig.  7A ). Nearly 50% of LA w-hydroxylase activity was inactivated by 50 I.IM UDYA. However, a much smaller percentage (20-30%) of LA (w-l)-and (w-2)-hydroxylases were destroyed under similar preincubation conditions. This preferential inactivation of LA whydroxylases was observed over a large concentration range of UDYA (Fig. 7B) . This differential inactivation of LA hydroxylases was not observed when a nonspecific suicide substrate for cytochrome P-450, l-aminobenzotriazole ( 12) , was preincubated with hepatic microsomes; approximately 70% of all three LA hydroxylase activities was lost following a 30-min preincubation with 100 PM 1 -aminobenzotriazole (data not shown).\nThe microsomal metabolism of LA has been investigated in a variety of in vitro sys- terns (1, 2, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . The metabolism of LA has which clofibrate is the prototypical inducer been used extensively to characterize a sub- (22) . The biochemical sequelae of this inpopulation of cytochrome F45Os, collec-duction is a dramatic increase in LA w-hytively referred to as cytochromes P-452 (8) . droxylase activity (22) . that at least three isozymes of cytochrome P-450 support the microsomal metabolism of LA (12) . Furthermore, the position of hydroxylation is dictated by the specific forms of cytochrome P-450 which are present in rat hepatic microsomes. Therefore, the site-specific hydroxylation of LA could be used to document the presence or absence of specific isozymes of cytochrome P-450 in microsomal suspensions.\nMany of the traditional methods used for assay of LA hydroxylase activity do not differentiate between the hydroxylated metabolites (8, 12) . However, the use of gas and, more recently, liquid chromatographic techniques has allowed the separation of the wand (w-l)-hydroxylated metabolites of LA ( 1,2,10,13). Both techniques generally require the use of a radiolabeled substrate and fairly elaborate derivatization techniques for quantitation and separation of permethylated metabolites. Orton and Parker have utilized reverse phase HPLC with flowthrough radiochemical detection to quantitate the w-and (w-l)-hydroxylated metabolites of LA without derivatization (11). Recently, Welch and coworkers have described a normal phase HPLC system for the separation of the w-and (w-I)-hydroxylated metabolites of LA ( 14). However, both of these analytical techniques have not been well characterized for precision, accuracy, and practical limits of quantitation.\nFurthermore, none of the above-mentioned techniques has allowed for the detection and quantitation of the (w-2)-hydroxylated metabolite of LA in mammalian microsomal incubations. The techniques described for quantitation of the three microsomal metabolites of LA in the present study provide reproducible and linear results over a range of concentrations that are anticipated for most in vitro conditions. The practical limit of quantitation of each LA metabolite was approximately 0.25 nmol/ml.\nUsing standard assay conditions, this would allow accurate quantitation of LA (w-2)-hydroxylase activities one-20th of those observed in most microsomal incubations from rats.\nThe hydroxylation of LA at the (w-2) position has been reported in certain plant and bacterial systems (23, 24) . Furthermore, the hydroxylation of PGEr and PGEz at the (w-2) position has been reported previously by Kupfer and co-workers (15) . However, the hydroxylation of LA at the (w-2) position has not been reported previously as a significant pathway of LA metabolism in mammalian microsomes. This is probably due to the inability to adequately resolve (w-2)-hydroxy-LA from (w-l)-hydroxy-LA.\nUsing reverse phase HPLC with flow-through radiochemical detection it is possible to adequately resolve (w-2)-and (w-l)-hydroxy-LA by decreasing the residence time within the radiochemical flow cell. As demonstrated in the present study, a decreased residence time can be achieved by increasing the flow rate through the cell as well as by decreasing the actual flow cell size. The (w-2)-hydroxylation of PGE, and PGE2 is also supported by hydrogen peroxide (15) . A similar phenomena was observed when LA was incubated in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.\nAs has been previously reported for PGE, and PGE2 ( 15), hydrogen peroxide-dependent metabolism of LA resulted in a ratio ((w-l) or (w-2)/0) of hydroxylated metabolites that was markedly different than that produced when NADPH was used to support LA metabolism. This suggests that the w-hydroxylation of LA was supported by different isozymes of cytochrome P-450 than those which support the (o-l)-and (o-2)-hydroxylations of LA. Previous investigators, utilizing suicide substrates and competitive inhibitors of LA metabolism, have demonstrated that the w-and (w-1)-hydroxylations of LA are supported by different isozymes of cytochrome P-450 (10,12). In the present study, similar approaches for dissociating the three (o-, w-l, w-2) lauric acid hydroxylase activities were utilized in an attempt to demonstrate isozyme specific positional hydroxylation of LA. The competitive inhibitors, cY-naphthoflavone, metyrapone, and SK&F 525-A, had differential effects on the various LA hydroxylases. While SK&F 525-A inhib-lases could not be achieved with the orobes 14. Clarke, M. J., Hawke, R. L., and Welch, R. M. used in the present study suggesting that a similar isozyme(s) of cytochrome P-450 supports these two hydroxylations. Further confirmation of these results will require purification of all three enzyme activities from hepatic microsomes.\nIn summary, an assay for the microsomal hydroxylation of LA, based on HPLC with flow-through radiochemical detection, has been developed. The products formed, (w)hydroxy-LA, (o-I)-hydroxy-LA, and the novel mammalian metabolite (w-2)-hydroxy-LA, could be quantitated with high precision and accuracy with minimal sample manipulation.\nThe biochemical dissociation of o-hydroxylase activity from (o-l)-and (w-2)-hydroxylases suggests that different isozymes of cytochrome P-450 support these reactions.",

Conditions were optimized for resolution and quantitation of three microsomal metabolites of LA, one of which has not been reported previously as a metabolite of LA in mammalian microsomal incubations. These products, 12-(\u03c9)-hydroxy-LA, 11-(\u03c9-1)-hydroxy-LA, and a novel metabolite, 10-(\u03c9-2)-hydroxy-LA, were isolated by HPLC and identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In the presence of NADPH, the formation of all three metabolites was linear with time and microsomal protein concentration. Hydrogen peroxide also supported the microsomal metabolism of LA, although the ratio of metabolites was substantially different than that produced by NADPH-supported microsomes. Several biochemical probes (metyrapone, \u03b1-naphthoflavone, 2-diethylaminoethyl-2,2-diphenylvalerate hydrochloride, and 10-undecynoic acid) were used to dissociate the three LA hydroxylase activities. These experiments suggest that the site-specific hydroxylation [\u03c9-, (\u03c9-1)-, (\u03c9-2)-] of LA may be catalyzed by different isozymes of cytochrome P-450.",

    "title": "Phospholipid vesicles containing bovine heart mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase exhibit proton translocating activity in the presence of gramicidin",
    "body_text": "vesicles containing bovine heart mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COV) were characterized for electron transfer and proton translocating activities in the presence of the mobile potassium ionophore, valinomycin, and the channel-forming ionophore, gramicidin, in order to determine if the ionophores modify the functional properties of the enzyme. In agreement with previous work, incubation of COV with valinomycin resulted in a perturbation of the absorbance spectrum of oxidized heme uu3 in the Soret region (430 nm); gramicidin had no effect on the heme aa3 absorbance spectrum. Different concentrations of the two ionophores were required for maximum respiratory control ratios in COV; 40-to 70-fold higher concentrations of valinomycin were required to completely uncouple electron transfer activity when compared to gramidicin. The proton transloeating activity of COV incubated with each ionophore gave a similar apparent proton translocated to electron transferred stoichiometry (H+/e-ratio) of 0.66 + 0.10. However, COV treated with low concentrations of gramicidin (0.14 mg/g phospholipid) exhibited 1.5-to 2.5-fold higher rates of alkalinization of the extravesicular media after the initial proton translocation reaction than did COV treated with valinomycin, suggesting that gramicidin allows more rapid equilibration of protons across the phospholipid bilayer during the proton translocation assay. Moreover, at higher concentrations of gramicidin (1.4 mg/g phospholipid), the observed H+/e-ratio decreased to 0.280 + 0.020, while the rate of alkalinization increased an additional 2-fold, suggesting that at higher concentrations, gramicidin acts as a proton ionophore.\n' Supported by a grant from the American Heart Association-Ohio Affiliate.\n' To whom correspondence should be addressed. These results support the hypothesis that cytochrome c oxidase is a redox-linked proton pump that operates at similar efficiencies in the presence of either ionophore. Low concentrations of gramicidin dissipate the membrane potential in COV most likely by a channel mechanism that is different from the carrier mechanism of valinomycin, yet does not make the phospholipid bilayer freely permeable to protons. 0 1991 Academic P~-s. he.\nCytochrome c oxidase (COX4 EC 1.9.3.1), the terminal electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, reduces molecular oxygen to water (1) and conserves the energy of its oxidation-reduction reactions by the vectorial translocation of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane (2). One proton (per electron transferred by the enzyme) is translocated across the mitochondrial inner membrane (3,4), while an additional proton is abstracted from the intravesicular space (mitochondrial matrix) to be used in the catalytic reduction of oxygen (5, 6).\nThe observation of proton translocating activity in COX when in uiuo (in the mitochondrial inner membrane) or when reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles (COV) requires the presence of membrane potential dissipating agents such as valinomycin plus potassium (2, 3, (7) (8) (9) . In 4 Abbreviations used: COX, cytochrome c oxidase; COV, phospholipid vesicles containing cytochrome c oxidase; COV (+TX), phospholipid vesicles containing cytochrome c oxidase preincubated in Triton X-100; H+/e-, ratio of vectorial protons translocated per electron transferred, RCR, respiratory control ratio; Hepes, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-l-piperazineethanesulfonic acid; RCR,,d, respiratory control ratio determined in the presence of valinomycin;\nCCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone;\nTX-100, Triton X-100; RCR,,,, respiratory control ratio determined in the presence of gramicidin; PL, phospholipid. either case, vectorial proton translocation across the phospholipid bilayer and consumption of protons by the enzyme during the oxygen reduction reaction create a large electrical potential difference across the membrane (2, 10). Addition of valinomycin collapses the membrane potential by coordinating potassium ions and carrying these ions across the phospholipid bilayer by a mobile carrier mechanism (11). Under these conditions, COX both in the mitochondrial membrane and in COV exhibits a maximum proton translocated to electron transferred ratio (H+/e-) approaching 1.0 (6).\nRecently, Steverding and Kadenbach (12, 13) have shown that valinomycin directly interacts with COX as evidenced by a perturbation of the oxidized absorbance spectrum at 430 nm and a modification of the steadystate kinetics of cytochrome c interaction with COX upon the addition of valinomycin. Similar modifications of COX properties were also observed with another mobile potassium ionophore, nonactin (13) . The conclusions drawn from these data were that valinomycin binds directly to COX and that the modified form of the enzyme translocates protons with the observed H+/e-stoichiometry of 1. Other work has shown that the electron transfer activity of COX is inhibited at high valinomycin concentrations, supporting the idea that valinomycin interacts with the enzyme (14) (15) (16) .\nThe recent data obtained with valinomycin indirectly suggest that the extensively studied proton translocating function of COX could be due to a modification of the enzyme's conformational or even biophysical properties in the presence of this ionophore. In order to clarify the proton translocating activity of the enzyme, we investigated the proton-pumping activity of COX in COV utilizing the channel-forming ionophore, gramicidin (17,lB). We chose gramicidin as an ionophore because of its ability to mimic valinomycin in energy-dependent cation uptake and swelling in mitochondria and as a general membrane potential dissipating agent in other energy-transducing membranes (11). In the presence of low concentrations of gramicidin, we observe H+/e-ratios similar to those of COV treated with valinomycin.\nThe spectral perturbation observed with valinomycin is not observed with gramicidin, supporting the idea that COX is a oxidationreduction-linked proton pump with the stoichiometry first described by Wikstrom and associates (2, 3).\nEnzyme preparation. COX (7.0-9.0 nmol heme a/mg protein) was isolated from submitochondrial particles prepared by sonication of bovine heart mitochondria (19) as described by Yonetani (20) . COX concentration was determined by using two extinction coefficients: 16.5 mM-' cm-i for reduced heme a at A As05-630 nm (21) and 164 mM-' cm-i for reduced minus oxidized heme oa3 at 442 nm (22). Horse heart cytochrome c concentration was determined at 550 nm using 20.5 mM-i (reduced minus oxidized) as the extinction coefficient (23). Protein was determined as described by Lowry et al. (24) .\nPreparation of phospholipid vesicles. COX was incorporated into phospholipid vesicles by cholate dialysis at 4\"C, using the dialysis regime of DiBiase and Prochaska (25) . L-a-Phosphatidylcholine at 40 mg/ml final concentration was dispersed in 66 mM Nat cholate and 100 mM Hepes NaOH, pH 7.2, by sonication at O\u00b0C. COX was preincubated in 3 mg TX-lOO/mg COX at 0\u00b0C for 30 min [See Wilson and Prochaska (16) for full details] prior to the addition to the phospholipid mixture. The final concentration of heme aus in the phospholipid vesicles [COV (+TX)] was 2-3 PM. Ninety-six percent of COX in the phospholipid vesicles had the cytochrome c binding domain oriented toward the extravesicular medium as determined by the method of Nicholls et al. (26) using a Gilford 2600 spectrophotometer.\nIn addition, 91% of the enzyme was incorporated into the phospholipid vesicles as determined by an ultracentrifugation assay (16) .\nDifference absorbance spectra of COV (+TX) in the presence of valinomycin or gramicidin.\nThe effects of gramicidin or valinomycin on the visible absorbance spectrum of oxidized COX in COV (+TX) were determined on an SLM DW-2c spectrophotometer in the split-beam mode in 100 mM sucrose, 100 mM KCl, and 10 mM Hepes NaOH, pH 7.2. Equivalent amounts of COV (+TX) [0.61 PM heme oas] were added to each cuvette and a baseline spectrum taken. Either gramicidin or valinomycin in methanol (20 /IM for each) was then added to the sample cuvette with an equivalent volume of methanol added to the reference cuvette. After a lo-min incubation period at 2O\"C, the difference spectrum was taken and then corrected for the baseline spectrum.\nRespiratory control assays. All electron transfer and respiratory control assays were performed in a thermostated cell at 25'C using an oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Model 17372). COV (+TX) (20-30 pmol heme aua) were assayed for electron transfer activity in 18 mM ascorbate, 40 PM cytochrome c, and 50 mM KH,PO,/K,HPO,, pH 7.4.\nRCR and RCRal of COV (+TX) were determined by the sequential addition of the ionophores to the assay mixture as described previously (16) . RCR is defined as the rate of electron transfer in the absence of any gradients across the phospholipid bilayer (in the presence of 5.6 PM valinomycin to dissipate the membrane potential and 5.6 /IM CCCP to collapse any pH gradient) divided by the rate of electron transfer in the absence of the uncoupling ionophores. RCR.,,, is defined as the rate of electron transfer of the phospholipid vesicles in the presence of valinomycin (5.6 PM) and CCCP (5.6 PM) divided by the rate of electron transfer in the presence of valinomycin alone. Similarly, RCR,., is the rate of electron transfer in the phospholipid vesicles in the presence of gramicidin (0.1 FM) and CCCP (5.6 PM) divided by the rate of electron transfer in the presence of gramicidin alone. All electron transfer rates in COV (+TX) were corrected for the autooxidation of cytochrome c. The RCR is expected to have a higher value (210) due to complete uncoupling of all gradients across the phospholipid bilayer, whereas RCR.1 and RCR,., will have lower values (<5) due to the presence of a membrane potential dissipating ionophore during the initial part of the assay (see Ref. (16) for complete details) Proton trandocation assays. Proton translocating activity was assayed at 25\u00b0C using a Corning Model 12 pH meter equipped with a combination electrode and a recorder as described previously (27). Electron transfer in COV (+TX) was initiated by the addition of ferrocytochrome c.\nReagents. Valinomycin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. or Calbiochem. Gramicidin, horse heart cytochrome c (Type III for electron transfer assays, Type VI for proton translocation assays), CCCP, TX-100, and L-a-phosphatidylcholine (Type II-S) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Gramicidin purity was assessed by its ultraviolet absorbance spectrum and also by thin layer chromatography on Kodak silica gel plates using chloroform/methanol (85/15, v/v) as the developing solvent (28). Cholic acid (Aldrich Chemical Co.) was recrystallized from ethanol. Hepes was obtained from U.S. Biochemical Corp. or Calbiochem.\nThe Effect of Ionophores on the Visible Absorbance Spectrum of COX in COV (+TX)\nThe substitution of an alternative ionophore for measuring cytochrome c oxidase proton translocating activity was investigated due to the possible modification of COX by the interaction of valinomycin with the enzyme (12, 13) . The effects of gramicidin on COX electron transfer and proton translocating activities were tested for two reasons: (i) gramicidin is a channel-forming ionophore, whereas valinomycin is a cyclic ionophore that performs its function as a mobile potassium carrier. The utilization of a membrane-spanning protein channel such as gramicidin could minimize the interaction of the ionophore with COX; (ii) gramicidin mimics valinomycin in its ability to stimulate energy-linked cation uptake and swelling in isolated mitochondria (11). Gramicidin also dissipates the membrane potential in both chloroplasts (as indicated by the abolition of the light-induced 515-nm absorbance change that is thought to reflect the buildup of a membrane potential in chloroplasts) and also mitochondria, suggesting similar cation permeabilities induced by the two ionophores in isolated membranes [see Ref. (11) and Discussion].\nThe visible absorbance spectrum of COX in COV (+TX) was determined in the presence and absence of the two ionophores (Fig. 1) . Figure 1A shows that the y band of oxidized heme a exhibits a red shift from 422 to 430 nm in valinomycin-treated COV (+TX) similar to that reported by Steverding and Kadenbach (12) . The absorbance change occurs at concentrations of valinomycin [E-50 mol/mol heme aaa] that support proton translocation by the enzyme. In gramicidin-treated COV (+TX) (Fig. lB) , no spectral shift is observed at concentrations of gramicidin (0.5-50 mol/mol heme aa3) that allow proton translocating activity, suggesting that gramicidin does not interact with COX in the same manner as valinomycin.\nA similar valinomycin-induced red shift in the oxidized difference spectrum is also observed in phospholipid vesicles containing subunit III-deficient COX (data not shown), suggesting that subunit III is not the subunit location of the putative valinomycin binding site on COX.\nIf gramicidin mimics valinomycin in its mechanism of interaction with COX, then the concentration dependencies of their effect on the electron transfer activity and respiratory control ratios of the enzyme in COV (+TX) as well as the general shape of the curves for the ionophores' effects on these activities should be similar. In Fig. 2 , the effects of various concentrations of ionophores on the respiratory control ratio, the respiratory control I  I  I  I  I  I  I   390nm  400nm  410nm  420nm  430nm  440nm  450nm FIG. 1. The effects of gramicidin and valinomycin on the visible absorbance spectrum of COX in COV (+TX). The difference spectrum of heme aa in COV (+TX) was determined in the presence of valinomycin (A) or gramicidin (B) as described under Materials and Methods using stoichiometries of 1.8 mg valinomycin/g PL or 3.1 mg gramicidin/g PL, respectively. ratio in the presence of valinomycin ( Fig. 2A) or the respiratory control ratio in the presence of gramicidin (Fig.  2B) , and completely uncoupled electron transfer activity of COV (+TX) are presented. All RCR parameters are defined under Materials and Methods. Our previous work has shown that the RCR,,, value of a preparation correlates with the proton-pumping activityof COX in phospholipid vesicles as a linear relationship (16) , whereas the RCR value does not show this linearity. Figure 2A shows that the maximum uncoupled electron transfer activity was observed at 18 mg valinomycin/g phospholipid (PL) (5.3 PM valinomycin in the assay); however, at higher concentrations of valinomycin, significant inhibition of electron transfer activity was observed (40%). The maximum RCR value and the uncoupled electron transfer rate occur at a similar concentration of valinomycin, whereas the minimum RCR,, value occurs at higher concentrations of valinomycin (150 mg valinomycin/g PL). Figure 2B shows that the maximum electron transfer activity and RCR occur at the same concentration of gramicidin (0.71 mg gramicidin/g PL, 0.08 PM gramicidin in the assay), although the minimum RCR,,,, value did not occur until much higher concentrations (5 mg gramicidin/g PL). Gramicidin caused a 20% inhibition of uncoupled electron transfer activity at the highest concentrations tested (12 PM gramicidin). Overall, the concentration dependencies for the effects of gramicidin and valinomycin on the electron transfer activity and RCR parameters were completely different. In fact, 40-to 70-fold less gramicidin was required to completely uncouple COX electron transfer activity, suggesting that the two ionophores may have different mechanisms of membrane potential dissipation. In mitochondria, gramicidin is 30-fold more efficient in dissipating the membrane potential than valinomycin (11).\nActivity of COX in COV (l-TX)\nSince the enzyme in COV (+TX) exhibited respiratory control in the presence of low concentrations of grami- cidin, the proton translocating activity of the enzyme in the presence of gramicidin was tested. Figure 3 shows proton translocation traces of COV (+TX) in the presence of valinomycin (A), low concentrations of gramicidin (B), and higher concentrations of gramicidin (C) at two COX turnovers (1 COX turnover = 4e-for cytochrome c/heme aas). Upon the addition of ferrocytochrome c to a solution of COV (+TX) (Fig. 3) , an acidification was followed by an alkalinization.\nThe acid phase represents vectorial proton translocation, whereas the alkaline phase reflects consumption of protons in the oxygen reduction reaction in the intravesicular space (6). In the presence of valinomycin (Fig. 3A ) or low concentrations of gramicidin (Fig.  3B) , similar extents of acidification were observed; however, the time course for the alkaline phase of the proton translocation reaction in gramicidin-treated COV (+TX) was much faster. At higher concentrations of gramicidin (Fig. 3C , lo-fold higher than in Fig. 3B ), the extent of acidification was decreased with an accompanying increase in the alkalinization rate. Similar data were obtained for COV (+TX) that had undergone five turnovers (20e-/heme a~).\nApparent H+/e-ratios were calculated from the data by using the extrapolation method of Krab and Wikstrom (3) and corrected for substoichiometric extents of alkalinization in the presence of CCCP (Table I) (29). At the low gramicidin concentration (Fig. 3B ) and in the presence of valinomycin (Fig. 3A) an H+/e-ratio of 0.64 was observed, while the H+/e-ratio at the higher concentration of gramicidin (Fig. 3C ) decreased to 0.26. Table I shows that the observed H+/e-stoichiometry in the presence of valinomycin is similar to the H+/e-stoichiometry in the presence of low concentrations of gramicidin (at 100 mM KCl, and 0.25 mM Hepes NaOH, pH 7.2, and changes in pH were monitored as described under Materials and Methods. In trace A, 2.8 mg valinomycin/g phospholipid was preincubated with COV (+TX), whereas in traces B and C, 0.14 and 1.41 mg gramicidin/g phospholipid were preincubated with COV (+TX). Apparent H+/e-ratios were calculated using the extrapolation method of Krab and Wikstrom (3) . The apparent H+/e-ratios [corrected by the method of Casey (29) 2 PM heme aa3. The assays were performed with 2.8 mg valinomycin/g phospholipid and 0.14 mg gramicidin/g phospholipid, respectively. * Apparent H+/e-stoichiometries were calculated as described under Materials and Methods (2). One enzyme turnover is defined as four cytochrome c molecules oxidized/heme oos. The numbers of determinations at two and five enzyme turnovers were 18 and 16 for valinomycin and 12 and 5 for gramicidin, respectively.\n' Rates of alkalinization were estimated from proton translocation traces in Fig. 2 and treated as pseudo-first-order processes. The numbers of determinations were 13 and 8 for valinomycin and 6 and 3 for gramicidin at two and five enzyme turnovers, respectively. both two or five enzyme turnovers), emphasizing that similar data for both ionophores were obtained at two different concentrations of cytochrome c added.\nFaster rates of alkalinization in the proton translocation assay (Fig. 3 ) are hypothesized to be due to an increase in the endogenous proton permeability of the COV and such preparations yield correspondingly lower H+/eratios (although this is not always the case, see Ref. (16)). Table I shows that the rates of alkalinization for valinomycin-treated COV (STX) are from 1.5-to 2.5fold slower than those for gramicidin-treated COV (+TX), yet the apparent H+/e-ratio is similar for both treatments. Gramicidin stimulates the alkalinization at both two and five enzyme turnovers, but the proton-pumping activity is similar to that of valinomycin-treated COV (+TX). In these measurements, a faster alkalinization rate does not correlate with a decreased H+/e-ratio. These data support our earlier observations that the rate of alkalinization in these assays is not due exclusively to changes in the proton permeability of the membrane (16) .\nHowever, the rates of alkalinization within the concentration dependence of gramicidin alone correlate with the apparent H+/e-ratio (Fig. 4) . At 0.14 mg gramicidin/ g PL, an optimum apparent H+/e-ratio was observed. At higher concentrations of gramicidin, a decrease in the apparent H+/e-ratio was observed with a corresponding increase in the alkalinization rate. If the concentration was increased to 5 PM gramicidin, no proton translocating activity was observed (A. J. Lincoln and L. J. Prochaska, unpublished observations) . Only a rapid alkalinization was observed which is indicative of complete uncoupling or membrane leakiness to protons. At the lowest concentration of gramicidin tested (0.047 mg gramicidin/g PL), the apparent H+/e-ratio and the alkalinization rate were both low, suggesting that the amount of gramicidin added was insufficient to dissipate the membrane potential [in agreement with previously published work (3)].\nProton translocation by COX both in the mitochondrial inner membrane and when reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles was first shown by Wikstrom and associates (2, 3) to require the addition of a membrane potentialdissipating ionophore such as valinomycin. Measurements of the membrane potential formed in COV suggest that a gradient of 66 mV is formed upon the initiation of electron transfer (10, 30) . Dissipation of the membrane potential is required for measurement of proton translocating activity in COV because the small size of COV (diameter of 250 A, Ref. (31)) causes a buildup of the membrane potential that inhibits COX electron transfer activity (30). Valinomycin has been used to dissipate the membrane potential in COV due to valinomycin's selectivity for potassium over other monovalent ions and also its ability to carry ions across a phospholipid bilayer by the mobile carrier mechanism. . COV (+TX) were assayed for proton translocating activity at various concentrations of gramicidin. The apparent H+/e-ratios (0) and the corresponding alkalinization rates (a) were determined at two enzyme turnovers. These data represent three individual preparations of COV (+TX) and the number of determinations was from 4 to 12 for all gramicidin concentrations tested.\nThe recent evidence that valinomycin interacts with COX suggests that the proton-pumping measurements performed on COV and the interpretations drawn from these experiments may have been clouded by a potential artifact. In this work, we tested COX proton translocating activity utilizing an alternative ionophore, gramicidin, in order to clarify the results obtained with valinomycin. We used gramicidin because of its channel-forming mechanism of action, thereby limiting the interaction of the ionophore with COX (17, 18). Also, gramicidin has a similarity in its physiological action in mitochondria with valinomycin (11).\nOur results show that COX proton translocating activity occurs in the presence of low concentrations of gramicidin and the data obtained qualitatively mimic those obtained with valinomycin; COX pumps protons with an apparent H+/e-ratio of approximately one. Gramicidin does not share the same mechanism of interaction with COX as valinomycin as evidenced by the lack of a change in the enzyme's visible absorbance spectrum upon the addition of gramicidin. Although the apparent H+/e-ratio is the same for both ionophores, the rate of alkalinization in the proton-pumping assay (Fig. 3) is faster for gramicidin than for valinomycin, suggesting that the mechanism of dissipation of the membrane potential by the two ionophores is different. Additional evidence for different mechanisms of action is that the concentration dependencies for the maximum stimulation of electron transfer activity and the respiratory control activities by the two ionophores are different (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, the addition of high concentrations of gramicidin (5 pM) leads to complete abolition of proton translocating activity with an accompanying increase in the rate of alkalinization, suggesting that at high concentrations, gramicidin acts as proton ionophore (see below).\nThe mechanism of the dissipation of the membrane potential in COV by gramicidin is unclear. The ion selectivity of gramicidin channels is H+ > NH: > Cs+ > Rb' > K+ > Naf > Li' as determined at 0.1 M concentrations using black lipid membranes (32, 33). Using the ion permeabilities derived from these experiments, protons are from 20-to 50-fold more permeable than potassium ions in the gramicidin channel. In liposomes, Deamer (34) estimated that the gramicidin channel is loo-fold more permeable to protons than to potassium ions and when unit permeability coefficients were calculated, protons were found to be 50,000 more permeable than potassium ions. It is unlikely that protons are dissipating the membrane potential in our experiments because we observe similar values of the apparent H+/e-ratio in COV treated with either gramicidin or valinomycin. In addition, the proton translocating activity of COV is not observed in the presence of proton-specific ionophores, such as CCCP (35). However, it is more likely that potassium ions not protons are dissipating the membrane potential due to the 1 X lo6 molar excess of potassium (0.1 M) over protons (10m7 M) under the conditions of our proton translocation assay. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that gramicidin (at low concentrations)\nis acting as an uncoupler in our experiments.\nOne additional experiment supports gramicidin acting as a membrane potential dissipating agent in our experiments. The electron transfer rate of COV (+TX) in the presence of high concentrations of gramicidin is not stimulated by the addition of valinomycin, suggesting that gramicidin is acting both as a proton ionophore and as a membrane potential dissipating ionophore under these experimental conditions. If a similar experiment is performed with an ionophore specific for protons only such as CCCP, subsequent addition of valinomycin is required for maximum electron transfer activity.\nProton translocating activity is observed when low concentrations of gramicidin are added to COV (+TX) (Fig. 3) . Under these conditions, there are from 0.5-2.5 gramicidin monomers per phospholipid vesicle (250 A diameter, based on intravesicular volume measurements). Thus, the number of gramicidin molecules per COV approximates the required dimeric species for the ion-conducting channel form of gramicidin (18). In our experiments, gramicidin is added only from the extravesicular medium, suggesting that the antiparallel dimers of gramicidin which exist in aqueous solution partition into the phospholipid bilayer and reorient into the active, ,&helical, dimeric form of gramicidin (17). Also, recent evidence shows that the conformation and oligomeric state of gramicidin are dependent on the carrier solvent of the ionophore (36). In our experiments, the solvent is methanol and gramicidin is a monomer, which can easily undergo a conformational change into the active, ion translocating P-helical conformer (36). Other recent data suggest that addition of gramicidin from one side of a bilayer results in some of the gramicidin monomers forming ion-conducting channels (37, 38) . In any event, the previous work with mitochondria suggests that effects of gramicidin occur by addition of the ionophore from only the external media (ll), supporting our results in COV.\nAn alternative explanation of our proton translocation data obtained with gramicidin is that gramicidin binds to COX and alters its functional activity in a manner similar to valinomycin, but does not cause a perturbation of the heme au3 spectrum of the enzyme. While our experiments cannot completely exclude this explanation, we think it is unlikely for the following reasons: (i) 40-to 70-fold less gramicidin is required to stimulate electron transfer and proton translocation than valinomycin. Proton transloeating activity is observed at 0.5-2.5 gramicidin monomers/COV, suggesting that the dimeric ion translocating unit of gramicidin is required for membrane potential dissipation in our experiments. If gramicidin does indeed bind to COX, the binding site (for a gramicidin dimer) or sites (two binding sites, one for each monomer) would have a much higher affinity than the putative valino-mycin-binding site on COX due to their vastly different concentration dependencies on electron transfer and proton translocating activities of the enzyme. We have been unable to observe any significant effects of gramicidin on the heme aa3 absorbance spectrum or the maximum rate of electron transfer even at the highest gramicidin/PL ratios (20% or less inhibition of electron transfer), suggesting that the previously described dimeric gramicidin channel is most likely the functioning species in our experiments (18); (ii) Nonactin and valinomycin require the presence of K+ ions to cause the spectral perturbation in heme aa in the enzyme, whereas ionophores such as nigericin and 18-crown-6 ether with K+ have no effect on the absorbance spectrum of the enzyme, suggesting that not all ionophores have the ability to bind to COX (12). In our view, our results are best explained by gramicidin acting as a membrane potential dissipating peptide channel.\nOur conclusion is that cytochrome c oxidase is a redoxassociated proton pump with a previously determined apparent H+/e-ratio of one. The interaction of valinomycin with COX does not dramatically affect the maximum proton translocating activity of the enzyme. Our work shows that gramicidin (at low concentrations) can effectively substitute for valinomycin as a membrane potential dissipating agent. Gramicidin apparently does not interact with COX in a manner similar to valinomycin, thus avoiding any possible perturbations of COX function similar to those induced by valinomycin. Our data do not address the possible effects of valinomycin on the electron transfer reactions of the enzyme or the valinomycin-induced perturbation of the regulation of COX conformations as described previously (12, 13) .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Phospholipid vesicles containing bovine heart mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COV) were characterized for electron transfer and proton translocating activities in the presence of the mobile potassium ionophore, valinomycin, and the channel-forming ionophore, gramicidin, in order to determine if the ionophores modify the functional properties of the enzyme. In agreement with previous work, incubation of COV with valinomycin resulted in a perturbation of the absorbance spectrum of oxidized heme aa 3 in the Soret region (430 nm); gramicidin had no effect on the heme aa 3 absorbance spectrum. Different concentrations of the two ionophores were required for maximum respiratory control ratios in COV; 40- to 70-fold higher concentrations of valinomycin were required to completely uncouple electron transfer activity when compared to gramidicin. The proton translocating activity of COV incubated with each ionophore gave a similar apparent proton translocated to electron transferred stoichiometry ( H+ e\u2212 ratio) of 0.66 \u00b1 0.10. However, COV treated with low concentrations of gramicidin (0.14 mg/g phospholipid) exhibited 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher rates of alkalinization of the extravesicular media after the initial proton translocation reaction than did COV treated with valinomycin, suggesting that gramicidin allows more rapid equilibration of protons across the phospholipid bilayer during the proton translocation assay. Moreover, at higher concentrations of gramicidin (1.4 mg/g phospholipid), the observed H+ e\u2212 ratio decreased to 0.280 \u00b1 0.020, while the rate of alkalinization increased an additional 2-fold, suggesting that at higher concentrations, gramicidin acts as a proton ionophore. These results support the hypothesis that cytochrome c oxidase is a redox-linked proton pump that operates at similar efficiencies in the presence of either ionophore. Low concentrations of gramicidin dissipate the membrane potential in COV most likely by a channel mechanism that is different from the carrier mechanism of valinomycin, yet does not make the phospholipid bilayer freely permeable to protons.",

    "title": "The oligomeric structure of renal aminopeptidase N from bovine brush-border membrane vesicles",
    "body_text": "Aminopeptidase N (APN) (EC 3.4.11.2) hydrolyses the N-terminal amino acid from a range of peptides. It constitutes a major protein in intestinal and renal brush borders. Recently APN has been shown to be the major receptor for the enteropathogenic coronavirus TGEV [1] and for human coronavirus 229E [2] . It has also been found to be one of the CD glycoproteins in human myeloid cell plasma membranes [3] .\nAPN is an ectoenzyme anchored to the brush-border membrane by a transmembrane helical region near the N-terminus [4] . A small region of the amino terminus protrudes into the cytoplasm. The main part of the protein, including the active site faces outside the cell and is connected to the transmembrane region by a short 'stalk' or junctional section. The proteinase papain (which has been used to solubilise APN) cleaves the enzyme at the end of the junction on the outer membrane surface [5] . The transmembrane stalk segment remains attached to the membrane while the rest of the molecule is detached with no loss of enzyme activity.\nCorrespondence to: S. Plakidou-Dymock, Department of Biochemistry, School of Medical Sciences, University Walk, Bristol BS8 1TD, UK. Abbreviations: APN, aminopeptidase N; BBMV, brush-border membrane vesicles; DMS, dimethyl suberimidate; DTBP, dimethyl 3,3'dithiobis(propionimidate); DPP IV, dipeptidyl peptidase IV.\nThe molecular size of intestinal microvillar APN and its postulated multimeric and subunit forms have been extensively studied (see Refs. 6 and 7 for reviews). Human and rat intestinal APN occurs as a symmetrical dimer of 130 kDa and rabbit APN occurs as a monomer [6] . SDS gel electrophoresis of pig APN shows at least three separate subunits [8, 9] , and a number of different structures for this enzyme have been postulated [10] . Some of the subunit forms of the pig enzyme are due to proteolysis in vivo or in vitro. In contrast only limited studies have been carried out on APN from renal brush borders. In an early report pig kidney APN was reported to form high molecular weight aggregates which dissociated into a 280 kDa which further dissociated to yield a subunit of 140 kDa [11] .\nThe renal enzyme has some particular points of interest. Unlike the intestinal enzyme which hydrolyses dietary peptides, the renal enzyme has no established physiological function although it is present in great abundance. We have recently presented evidence to suggest that bovine renal APN plays a role in Na +-dependent amino acid transport in bovine brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) [12] . A number of other studies have recently implicated similar proteins (i.e., polypeptides with only one transmembrane region) in the regulation of Na+-independent amino acid transport [13, 14] . A model for such a protein acting as some sort of transport system would be more feasible if the proteins had more than one transmembrane region. This could be achieved by association of the protein into oligomeric structures. A number of studies suggest that intestinal APN can form dimers and other structures with its breakdown products, but it is not known if this is also the case in renal membranes [9, 10] .\nBBMV when separated on polyacrylamide gels yield a complex mixture of polypeptides. Identification of any of the constituents can prove problematic. Even though APN is a major constituent (about 5%) of bovine BBMV, discernment of any of its postulated subunits or breakdown products has proved to be difficult. The technique of covalent cross-linking with bifunctional agents has been used in a number of cases to determine oligomeric structures of specific proteins within complex mixtures including intestinal APN [10, 9] . In this paper the techniques of cross-linking, immunoaffinity column purification and N-terminal sequence analysis are used to elucidate the oliogomeric structure of bovine renal APN.\nPreparation and fractionation of bovine BBMI~. Vesicles were isolated from fresh bovine kidney by a modification of the MgC12 precipitation method [16] as described in detail elsewhere [17] except that mannitol was replaced by an equal concentration of sucrose in the homogenisation medium. The vesicles were washed and suspended in a medium containing 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM K + Hepes and 0.2 mM CaC12 at pH 7.4 and were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -20\u00b0C until used.\nCross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate (DMS) and dimethyl 3,3'-dithiobis(propionimidate) (DTBP). This was a modification of the method of Labb6 et al. [18] . BBMV were centrifuged at 100000 \u00d7 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C and the pellets resuspended in 100 mM triethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.3) at 2/zg protein//~l. Other protein samples were dialysed to remove Tris and resuspended in the above buffer. The cross-linker was made up in triethanolamine buffer at 30 mg/ml and added to the protein mixture to give a final concentration of 0.6 raM. After incubation at room temperature for the appropriate time the reaction was quenched by adding glycine to a final concentration of 100 mM glycine at pH 8. Samples were frozen at -20\u00b0C until analysed.\nImmunoaffinity chromatography. The monoclonal antibody FD19 was prepared as described in a previous paper [19] and was covalently attached to cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-activated Sepharose. Brush-border membranes were solubilised in the detergent MEGA-10 [20] in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (3 mg detergent/rag protein) and the solution was clarified by centrifugation at 100000 \u00d7g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. Aliquots of the suspension were passed down a column of FD19 attached to Sepharose. After washing with the same medium, the column was eluted with 50 mM dieth-ylamine pH 11 and samples were collected in 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) (to give 50 mM Tris-HCl \"final concentration). Fractions containing protein were pooled and concentrated using Amicon micro-concentrators.\nConcanavalin A column chromatography. This was performed as described by Doyle and McGivan [19] .\nPapain digestion. BBMV (10 mg protein in 1 ml) were digested with 2/xl of 25 mg/ml papain in 50 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 7.5) for 10 min at room temperature. To remove solubilised APN the suspension was centrifuged at 100 000 \u00d7 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C and the pellet was subsequently dissolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl/0.5% MEGA-10 (pH 7.4).\nPreparation of samples for N-terminal sequence analysis. Purified protein samples (typically 10 /.~g) prepared as described above were separated by SDS-PAGE and Electroblotted (LKB Semi-Dry Blotter) on to Pro-Blott membrane (Applied Biosystems). The desired bands were cut out and subjected to automated amino acid sequence analysis on a 477A/120A Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with the Blott cartridge using standard cycles.\nAssay of aminopeptidase activity. APN activity was assayed at 37\u00b0C in a medium containing 50 mM Tris-HCI at pH 7.4 together with 2 mM L-leucine-p-nitroanilide. The initial rate of increase of absorption at 410 nm was monitored continuously.\nGels and Western blotting. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli [21] . Western blotting was performed by the method of Towbin et al. [22] except that the nitrocellulose was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (0.14 M NaCI, 2.7 mM KCI, 1.5 mM KH2PO 4, 8.1 mM Na2HPO 4) containing 5% skimmed milk powder plus 0.2% Tween 20, and washed with phosphate buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween-20. Determinations of molecular weights were made from gels relative to known standards (Bio-Rad Broad-range for gels and Sigma Prestained for blots).\nScanning of gels and blots. Dried gels and blots were scanned using a Chromoscan 3 (Joyce Loebl, Tyne and Wear, UK) at 0.5 Absorbance full scale. Blots were scanned on the reflectance setting at the same sensitivity.\nProtein was assayed as described by Bradford [23] . DMS and DTBP were purchased from Sigma (Poole, Dorset). MEGA-10 was synthesised as described by Hildreth [20] . Peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA).\nDMS is a non-cleavable cross-linker and was used initially to avoid ambiguities due to partial hydrolysis products that may result from the use of cleavable cross-linkers during SDS-PAGE analysis. In preliminary experiments, intact BBMV were incubated at room temperature in the presence and absence of the DMS as described in Methods. Aliqouts were removed at various time points and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Incubation of BBMV at room temperature in the absence of cross-linker led to a progressive decrease in the amount of high molecular weight material and a concomitant increase in lower molecular weight degradation products. In the presence of DMS, protein bands of higher molecular weight accumulated at the expense of lower molecular weight material. This indicates that DMS is able to cross-link proteins in intact BBMV. Fig. 1 presents a Western blot of DMS treated and untreated BBMV blotted with the monoclonal antibody FD19. This antibody reacts with the 130-150 kDa aminopeptidase N monomer of bovine renal brush borders (described in Refs. 19 and 12) . It also reacts with a 260 kDa band and a 45 kDa band in the BBMV preparation. After 110 min at room temperature the 260 kDa band from BBMV disappeared ( Fig. l(b) ) but this band, as well as the new aminopeptidase N-complexed material was seen when BBMV were incubated with DMS (Fig. 1 ). Further incubation in DMS (to 17 h) culminated in the production of Coomassie-stained products in the stacking section of the gel with very little material entering the separating part of the gel. It is probable from these observations that DMS is acting to stabilise higher molecular weight complexes already present in BBMV but prone to degradation during storage. This seems very likely since the 260 kDa APN complex is already present in BBMV but increased in quantity in the presence of DMS. The production of the smallest (45 kDa) breakdown product of APN which still has the FD19 recognised isotope is also prevented on addition of DMS ( Fig. 1, arrow 4) , and perhaps also re-associated into higher molecular weight products as suggested from Fig. l(c) where the 45 kDa product is no longer present.\nThe highest molecular weight complexes of APN are seen more clearly in FD19-immunoaffinity column purified DMS-treated BBMV. The scan is presented in Fig. 2 . As well as the monomer, the 220 kDa and 260 kDa complexes were recognised. By comparison with the FD19 column purified APN from untreated BBMV (Fig. 5, scan a) , it is apparent that complexes of the same M r are normally present in BBMV but in smaller amounts. Thus DMS is increasing and stabilising associations between proteins which normally occur in BBMV.\nAPN is a glycoprotein and as such can be partially purified from solubilised BBMV using the lectin Concanavalin A (ConA). A time course of the cross-linking of the ConA-purifled fraction is presented in Fig. 3 . Incubation of the ConA fraction with DMS resulted in the formation of the 220 and 260 kDa complexes within 5 min and these were stable even after 17 h. In BBMV (not shown), higher molecular weight material continued to be formed such that there was less material entering the separating part of the gels during the same time points. Thus the ConA glycoprotein fraction contains the components which associated with APN to form the 220 kDa, and 260 kDa complexes seen in BBMV. That these were APN complexes was confirmed by blotting with FD19 (Fig. 4) .\nThat the process of formation of high molecular weight complexes was not entirely random was confirmed by Western blot analysis of the 100 kDa protein seen in the ConA fraction and in BBMV (data not shown). In BBMV this band disappears within 30 min into a higher molecular weight complex as shown by blotting with the monoclonal antibody FD12 which specifically reacts with this polypeptide (described in Ref. 12) . But in the ConA fraction the 100 kDa band was still visible after 17 h suggesting that the proteins it normally cross-links to in BBMV are not present in the purified ConA fraction.\nCross-linking with DMS of the FD19 immunoaffinity column purified aminopeptidase N Immunoaffinity column purified APN was treated with DMS and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5) . As can be seen from scan b, both the 220 kDa and 260 kDa complexes were made in quantity. This confirms that these complexes were composed of APN and any of its breakdown products. Therefore the 260 kDa complex seen in native BBMV and increased by cross-linking is likely to be a dimeric form of APN. The 220 kDa complex may be APN cross-linked to one or more of its subunits.\nDTBP is a thiol-cleavable cross-linker. Cross-linking of BBMV proteins and then immunopurifying APN complexes would allow analysis of any proteins cross-linked to APN by subsequent thiol reduction of the cross-linker.\nIn preliminary experiments, it was found that under similar conditions DTBP cross-linked BBMV proteins to a greater extent than did DMS. Fig. 6 shows scans of immunopurified APN complexes from DTBP cross-linked BBMV. Without reduction of the cross-linker very little material entered the separating part of the gel suggesting that the APN was cross-linked to products of > 300 kDa (limit of size for entry into 8% gel). Since essentially only the 260 kDa and 45 kDa products of APN were released on reduction of the crosslinker, the bulk of APN appeared to be cross-linking to itself. It was of interest to determine whether APN could cross-link to any other membrane proteins in situ. Under conditions of limited proteolysis papain cleaves APN at the junctional peptide region thus removing a 125 kDa polypeptide containing the active site and the FD19 epitope into the supernatant (described in Ref. 12) . The anchoring peptide region remains in the membrane. Papain digestion after cross-linking would remove the majority of the APN which is cross-linked to itself. Any APN cross-linked to other membrane peptides or cross-linked to substructures of itself which do not contain the papain site would remain in the membrane. In this way, effectively a concentration effect is achieved for the rarer cross-linking events.\nA preliminary experiment using DMS showed by enzyme assay that more APN remained associated with membranes after cross-linking. Cross-linking decreased the activity of APN by 28% within 30 min. Normally, 10% of the enzyme activity remains associated with the membranes after papain treatment. Cross-linking followed by papain digestion increased the amount of APN remaining on the membranes by 130%.\nBBMV treated with DTBP were subjected to limiting papain cleavage. The membrane pellets were solubilised and passed through a FD19 column. The FD19 recognised material was then analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western blots and the results are presented in Fig.  7 . Comparing Fig. 7(a) with Fig. 6(b) shows that the number of bands between the dimer and monomer of APN has increased and a greater number of smaller polypeptides also appeared.\nThe released polypeptides from the above experiment were further analysed by passage through a FD19 column. Both the effluent and bound material were analysed on silver stained gels and the released polypeptides are shown in Fig. 8 . Preparative gels were run and the 120 kDa, 95 kDa, 80 kDa, 66 kDa and 45 kDa polypeptides were subjected to N-terminal amino acid analysis. The 80 kDa polypeptide was N-terminally blocked and therefore no analysis is as yet available. The 120 kDa polypeptide had the same N-terminal sequence as rat dipeptidyl peptidase(IV) ( Fig. 9(a) ) [24] . The 66 kDa peptide had an N-terminal sequence which corresponded to human APN ( Fig. 9(b) amino acids 457 to 472 [25] . Both the 95 kDa and the 45 kDa fragments had the same N-terminus ( Fig. 9 (c)), and this corresponded to the human APN sequence from amino acids 296 to 305 [25] . The 45 kDa fragment was sequenced from untreated BBMV.\nBovine renal APN was cross-linked using two different bifunctional cross-linking reagents. The results show that the non-cleavable reagent DMS acted as a weaker cross-linker leaving a significant amount of the APN in the monomer state (130 kDa). The thiol-cleavable reagent DTBP cross-linked BBMV material to a greater extent and left no detectable APN monomer, dimer or other complexes of < 300 kDa. On cleavage of this cross-linker, the monomer and dimer were released. The span of the DMS molecule is 11 A and that of o DTBP is 11.9 A. APN molecules therefore associate sufficiently closely in BBMV to allow extensive crosslinking.\nReduction of DTBP-APN complexes released a number of polypeptides in quantity and purity such that they could be subjected to automated N-terminal analysis. The 45 kDa product was derived from detergent-solubilised BBMV preparations. Since the Nterminal sequence corresponds to an internal sequence of human [25] and rat [26] APN it is a breakdown product of the 130 kDa APN monomer and may be be formed by autolysis or cleavage by some other endogenous proteinase. This fragment was readily detected in Western blots and hence has the FD19-recognising epitope. The 95 kDa product is unlikely to have arisen from papain cleavage since it has the same N-terminus as the 45 kDa polypeptide. The peptide bond before this N-terminus is obviously labile and easily attacked. The 66 kDa product has a different sequence which is also found in the human APN and is hence also a breakdown product. This may have been produced by papain cleavage. Although the primary sequence of bovine renal APN has not yet been determined, the similarity of these internal sequences with those of human intestinal APN [25] suggest that the sequence of this enzyme is highly conserved.\nIt is of interest that the 120 kDa released product proved to be dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV). Association between these two very similar ectoenzymes has not been previously reported. The products of DPP IV activity are dipeptides which can act as substrates for APN.\nThe above findings can be compared with previous work on intestinal APN. The 'subunits' seen with pig intestinal APN preparations have been characterised in terms of size on gels [8, 10] . On the basis of peptide mapping of products released after cross-linking Svensson [10] postulated that the 168 kDa APN gave rise to 118 kDa and 54 kDa products and that the 54 kDa subunit was not a breakdown product of the 118 kDa species. The reported sizes of both the monomer and subunits are inconsistent with the present work on the bovine renal enzyme as well as other work [8] .\nMaroux et al. [8] reported the following sizes for pig intestinal APN: 130 kDa, 96 kDa and 48 kDa. This pattern of subunits was observed in trypsin or papain treated membranes or by spontaneous dissociation of APN. Other minor bands of 116 kDa, 76 kDa and 66 kDa bands were observed after proteolytic dissociation. It is possible that the 116 kDa band corresponded to the 120 kDa band now identified as dipeptidyl peptidase IV in the bovine renal system. The 96 kDa and 48 kDa bands could also correspond to the 95 kDa and 45 kDa products characterised in the present study.\nA previous study on pig renal APN [11] suggested that aggregates of APN solubilised in Triton decompose into 280 kDa products which on further autolysis yield a product of 140 kDa. Trypsin dissociation of the aggregates yielded products of 140 kDa 95 kDa and 48 kDa.\nFrom the above two studies, the 95 kDa and 45 kDa fragments may be common to both pig renal and intestinal forms of the enzyme. In bovine renal APN these two fragments have been shown to arise from cleavage of a specific common peptide bond. The cleavage site can be derived from the Fig. 9 and the known human APN sequence as between methionine and serine in the sequence: This site is also conserved in the kidney APN sequence from rat [26] .\nIn summary, bovine renal APN has been shown to form oligomeric structures and to associate with DPP IV. Apparent subunits dissociating from the oligomeric structures have been shown to be breakdown products. The pattern of enzyme association and the formation of breakdown products may be similar to those reported in intestine.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bovine renal brush-border membrane vesicle aminopeptidase N at various stages of purity was treated with two bifunctional cross-linking agents. A pattern of emergence of higher molecular weight forms was observed. By using a cleavable cross-linker, aminopeptidase N was shown to cross-link both to itself and to its breakdown products as well as to dipeptidyl peptidase IV. Using this technique it was possible to identify three of the breakdown products as 45 kDa, 66 kDa and 95 kDa peptides. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was used to define the precise cleavage points for the bovine renal aminopeptidase N breakdown products. The short amino acid sequences obtained show strong sequence similarity with the human intestinal and rat kidney aminopeptidase N.",

    "body_text": "Once the program is called, and a short description of the available predictions has been displayed, the user is requested to enter the sequence file-name.\nThe sequence is then loaded and displayed on the screen together with its total length.\nUp to 1800 amino acid residues are accepted for analysis, which is far enough to deal with most protein sequences. Then the user is asked to enter the window size for hydrophilicity-hydropathyantigenicity calculations and the Garnier's decision constant for a-helix and l3-sheet prediction.\nA default window size value of 6 is suggested, according to the recommendations of Hopp (14) .\nTo make the program easier to use and as an option, the sequence file-name and window size can be specified as parameters following the program name when calling it. In the example we shall examine later, this would be done by typing PREDICT7 IMP.AA 6.\nOnce the sequence has been loaded and the constants defined, calculations of the seven predictions will start, taking about 3 seconds for a typical 250 residue sequence in an IBM AT computer. After calculations have finished, the main menu is displayed. From it and its subnenus, many options are available covering several aspects:\n-Kind of output, Both numeric results and graphics can be obtained in various ways. They can be stored in a file for later use, displayed on the screen, printed out, or plotted using HP-compatible plotters.\n-Graphical options. The four predictions to be shown, their order, and the region of the sequence (the total length by default)\ncan be defined. The user can, as well, choose whether to write the scales, ticks, zero lines or axis 1abel:s. All are shown by default, but if a different set of definitions is frequently used, it can be saved in a file called PREDICT'I.DAT.\n-Standard serial port settings. The plotter is connected to the computer through a RS232 interface.\nPort number, bauds, data bits, stop bits, and parity checking bit have to be set to the appropriate values.\nThis can be easily performed through a straight forward submenu and the new settings saved as before.\nSingle keystrokes allow shifting to submenus or options. The previous menu can be reached at any time by simply pressing the escape key (Esc). When data have 'been saved in a file, this is reminded to the user as exiting the program. Much care has been taken in designing the user interface in order to make the program as friendly as possible so that it can be used without reference to external instructions. Simple on-line help screens are available from any menu pressing the Fl key.\n(b) Using the program As an example, we have run the program using the sequence of one of the proteins we are currently investigating. This is the matrix protein of There is a number of protein structure prediction programs available. Some are integrated in complex commercial DNA/protein analysis packages, while others are freely available to the scientific community. These later programs have shown its usefulness, but have three major shortages. They usually do not have any graphical capacity, which is essential for a proper understanding of the predicted structures, they can not simultaneously analyze more than one protein structure feature, and they are not very fast. Although some of the commercial programs do overcome these deficiencies they are not freely available to the academic community, are usually expensive and sometimes need mainframe computers to be implemented. From these considerations, we believe PREDICT7 can be useful to other investigators in this field.\n(d) Availability of the program PREDICT7 is available to anyone for non-commercial use upon request by sending a 5% inch formatted blank diskette to the authors. A copy of the program can also be obtained via EARN/BITNET by requesting it to CMSMD11@Eowov11. We would like to express our gratitude to F.Parra and C.L.Ct.in for the interest shown during the development of this work, and to J.Riera for his technical advice.",
